Added `showOnlyVerifiedContacts` policy to PolicyManager:
```swift
/// Whether to show only verified contacts in compose message picker
var showOnlyVerifiedContacts: Bool { get set }
```

### 2. **Enhanced ContactPickerViewModel**
- âœ… **Smart Filtering**: Filters by verification status based on user preference

- âœ… **Toggle Function**: Easy switching between all/verified contacts

### 3. **Improved ContactPickerView UI**
- âœ… **Filter Toggle**: "Show only verified contacts" toggle at the top
- âœ… **Contact Counter**: Shows how many contacts are displayed
- âœ… **Empty State Handling**: Different messages for no contacts vs no verified contacts

## ðŸ“± User Experience Flow

### **Default Behavior**
1. Contact picker opens showing all non-blocked contacts
