# Settings ViewModel Build Fix - Complete

## Problem
The SettingsViewModel had build errors due to:
1. `policyManager` was declared as `let` but code was trying to assign to its properties
2. Missing PolicyManager type definitions
3. Complex dependencies in the main PolicyManager implementation

## Root Cause
The original code tried to use `self?.policyManager.property = newValue` in Combine sink closures, but Swift compiler interpreted this as trying to assign to the `policyManager` property itself rather than its properties, causing the "cannot assign to property: 'policyManager' is a 'let' constant" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Simple Protocol
```swift
protocol SettingsPolicyManager {
    var contactRequiredToSend: Bool { get set }
    var requireSignatureForVerified: Bool { get set }
    var autoArchiveOnRotation: Bool { get set }
}
```

### 2. Created UserDefaults Implementation
```swift
class UserDefaultsSettingsPolicyManager: SettingsPolicyManager {
    // Simple UserDefaults-based implementation
    // Uses the same keys as the main PolicyManager for compatibility
}
```

### 3. Fixed Property Declaration
Changed from:
```swift
private let policyManager: SettingsPolicyManager
```
To:
```swift
private var policyManager: SettingsPolicyManager
```

### 4. Improved Closure Pattern
Changed from:
```swift
.sink { [weak self] newValue in
    self?.policyManager.contactRequiredToSend = newValue
}
```
To:
```swift
.sink { [weak self] newValue in
    guard let self = self else { return }
    self.policyManager.contactRequiredToSend = newValue
}
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Simplified Dependencies**: No longer depends on complex PolicyManager with Contact/WhisperError types
2. **Maintains Compatibility**: Uses same UserDefaults keys as main PolicyManager
3. **Clean Architecture**: Focused protocol for settings-specific needs
4. **Proper Memory Management**: Uses guard let self pattern for safe weak references

## Files Modified
