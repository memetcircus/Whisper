# Compose View UX Improvements and Build Fix

## Problems Addressed

### UX Issues
1. **Poor width and spacing** in "From Identity" and "To" sections
2. **Unnecessary "Options" title** when only one option exists (Include Signature)
3. **Inconsistent font sizing** and visual hierarchy
4. **Poor button styling** for contact selection

### Build Errors
1. **Missing ContactPickerViewModel** - referenced but didn't exist
2. **Non-existent method calls** - `loadVerifiedContactsOnly()` didn't exist
3. **Broken contact picker functionality**

## Solutions Implemented

### UX Improvements

1. **Better Section Spacing and Layout**
   - Increased section spacing from 20pt to 24pt
   - Improved padding: 16pt horizontal, 12pt vertical for sections
   - Better overall view padding: 20pt horizontal, 16pt vertical

2. **Improved Font Hierarchy**
   - Changed section headers from `.headline` to `.subheadline` with `.fontWeight(.semibold)`
   - More appropriate font sizes throughout

3. **Enhanced Visual Design**
   - Updated corner radius to 12pt for modern look
   - Consistent background styling across all sections
   - Better spacing within sections (12pt instead of 8pt)

4. **Removed Unnecessary "Options" Title**
   - Since there's only one option (Include Signature), removed the redundant section title
   - Cleaner, more streamlined interface

5. **Improved Contact Selection**
   - Made "Select Contact" button more prominent with `.borderedProminent` style
   - Full-width button for better accessibility and visual impact

### Build Fixes

1. **Replaced Non-existent ContactPickerViewModel**
   - Used existing `ContactListViewModel` instead
   - Maintained all required functionality

2. **Fixed Method Calls**
   - Replaced `loadVerifiedContactsOnly()` with `loadContacts()`
   - Added proper contact filtering logic

3. **Enhanced Contact Picker**
   - Added toggle for "Show only verified contacts"
   - Proper filtering between verified and all contacts
   - Better empty state handling for both scenarios

## Code Changes

### Before (UX Issues)
```swift
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    Text("Options").font(.headline)
    // Poor spacing and font sizes
}
.padding()
```

### After (Improved UX)
```swift
VStack(spacing: 24) {
    // No unnecessary "Options" title
    // Better spacing and fonts
}
.padding(.horizontal, 20)
.padding(.vertical, 16)
```

### Before (Build Errors)
```swift
@StateObject private var contactManager = ContactPickerViewModel() // Doesn't exist
contactManager.loadVerifiedContactsOnly() // Doesn't exist
```

### After (Fixed)
```swift
@StateObject private var contactManager = ContactListViewModel() // Exists
contactManager.loadContacts() // Exists
// Added proper filtering logic
```
