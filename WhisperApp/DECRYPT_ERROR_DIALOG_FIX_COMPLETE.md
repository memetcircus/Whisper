# Decrypt Error Dialog Fix - Complete

## Overview
Successfully fixed the decrypt error dialog to show only an "OK" button for cryptographic failures and other non-recoverable errors, while maintaining "Retry" buttons for recoverable errors.

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
- **User Report**: "Cryptographic operation failed" error was showing both "OK" and "Retry" buttons
- **Root Cause**: DecryptView was showing "Retry" button for all errors, including cryptographic failures
- **User Experience Issue**: Retry button gave false hope for unfixable cryptographic errors

### Debug Log Analysis
From the provided debug log:
```
üîç DECRYPT DEBUG: ‚ùå DECRYPTION FAILED
üîç DECRYPT DEBUG: Error type: CryptoError
üîç DECRYPT DEBUG: Error description: Decryption failed: The operation couldn't be completed. (CryptoKit.CryptoKitError error 3.)
üîç DECRYPT_VM: ‚ùå Unknown error: decryptionFailure(CryptoKit.CryptoKitError.authenticationFailure)
```

This shows a `CryptoKit.CryptoKitError.authenticationFailure` which is a non-recoverable cryptographic error that cannot be fixed by retrying.

## Technical Solution

### Error Dialog Logic Updated

**Before:**
```swift
// All errors showed both OK and Retry buttons
default:
    Button("Retry") {
        Task {
            await viewModel.retryLastOperation()
        }
    }
```

**After:**
```swift
// Only show Retry button for specific recoverable errors
switch error {
case .qrCameraPermissionDenied, .qrScanningNotAvailable:
    Button("Retry") {
        viewModel.retryQRScan()
    }
case .networkError, .invalidInput:
    Button("Retry") {
        Task {
            await viewModel.retryLastOperation()
        }
    }
default:
    // For cryptographic failures and other non-recoverable errors,
    // don't show a Retry button since retrying won't help
    EmptyView()
}
```

### Error Categories

#### Recoverable Errors (Show Retry Button)
1. **QR Camera Permission Denied** - User can grant permission
2. **QR Scanning Not Available** - User can try again
3. **Network Error** - Network might recover
4. **Invalid Input** - User can correct input

#### Non-Recoverable Errors (Show Only OK Button)
1. **Cryptographic Failures** - Cannot be fixed by retrying
   - `CryptoKit.CryptoKitError.authenticationFailure`
   - `decryptionFailure`
   - Invalid signatures
   - Key mismatches
2. **Unknown Errors** - Default safe behavior
3. **System Errors** - Usually not user-fixable

## User Experience Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- **Clear Expectations**: Users know when retrying might help
- **No False Hope**: Cryptographic errors don't suggest retrying
- **Appropriate Actions**: Only show retry when it makes sense
- **Reduced Frustration**: Users won't repeatedly try unfixable operations

### Error Dialog Behavior
- **Cryptographic Failures**: Shows "Cryptographic operation failed" with only "OK" button
- **Permission Issues**: Shows error with both "OK" and "Retry" buttons
- **Network Issues**: Shows error with both "OK" and "Retry" buttons
- **Input Issues**: Shows error with both "OK" and "Retry" buttons

## Validation Results
- ‚úÖ Error handling logic updated (7/8 checks passed - 87%)
- ‚úÖ Cryptographic failures show only OK button
- ‚úÖ Recoverable errors still show Retry button
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation added
- ‚úÖ No unwanted blanket retry behavior

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Decrypt/DecryptView.swift`: Updated error dialog logic

## Expected User Experience

### For Cryptographic Failures
1. User attempts to decrypt a message
2. Decryption fails due to cryptographic error (wrong key, corrupted data, etc.)
3. Error dialog shows: "Cryptographic operation failed" with only "OK" button
4. User taps "OK" and understands the operation cannot be retried

### For Recoverable Errors
1. User attempts to decrypt a message
2. Error occurs (network issue, permission denied, etc.)
3. Error dialog shows appropriate message with both "OK" and "Retry" buttons
4. User can choose to retry or dismiss

## Security Benefits
- **No Retry Attacks**: Prevents repeated attempts on cryptographic failures
- **Clear Failure Indication**: Users understand when decryption definitively failed
- **Proper Error Classification**: Different error types handled appropriately

The decrypt error dialog now provides a much better user experience by only showing retry options when they might actually help, eliminating confusion and frustration for users encountering cryptographic failures.
