print("🧪 Testing Replay Protection Message Improvement...")
print(String(repeating: "=", count: 60))

print("✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:")
print("   - Original message: 'This message has already been processed'")
print("   - Too technical and doesn't explain WHY this is happening")
print("   - Users might think it's an error rather than security feature")

print("\n✅ IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED:")

print("\n📱 1. MAIN ERROR DESCRIPTION:")
print("   BEFORE: 'This message has already been processed. For security, messages can only be decrypted once.'")
print("   AFTER:  'This message was already decrypted once and cannot be processed again. This security feature protects you from replay attacks where malicious actors try to reuse intercepted messages.'")

print("\n🔍 2. DETAILED EXPLANATION:")
print("   BEFORE: 'Replay protection prevents the same message from being decrypted multiple times to protect against replay attacks.'")
print("   AFTER:  '🔒 Security Explanation: Each message can only be decrypted once to prevent \"replay attacks\" - a common hacking technique where attackers capture and reuse old encrypted messages. This protection ensures that even if someone intercepts your messages, they cannot be maliciously replayed later. To decrypt a message again, you'll need a fresh copy from the sender.'")

print("\n📋 3. ERROR TITLE:")
print("   BEFORE: 'Message Already Processed'")
print("   AFTER:  'Security Protection Active'")

print("\n💬 4. ALERT MESSAGE:")
print("   BEFORE: 'This message has already been processed.'")
print("   AFTER:  'This message was already decrypted once. For security, each message can only be processed once to prevent replay attacks.'")

print("\n🎯 BENEFITS OF NEW MESSAGES:")
print("   ✅ Educational: Explains what replay attacks are")
print("   ✅ Reassuring: Frames as security feature, not error")
print("   ✅ Actionable: Tells user how to get fresh message")
print("   ✅ Informative: Explains the security benefit")
print("   ✅ User-friendly: Uses clear, non-technical language")

print("\n📱 EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE:")
print("   - User understands this is a SECURITY FEATURE")
print("   - User learns about replay attack protection")
print("   - User knows they need fresh message to decrypt again")
print("   - User feels confident about app security")

print("\n🔒 SECURITY EDUCATION:")
print("   - Explains replay attacks in simple terms")
print("   - Shows how the app protects against them")
print("   - Builds user confidence in security measures")
print("   - Encourages security-conscious behavior")

print("\n" + String(repeating: "=", count: 60))
print("🎉 Replay protection messages improved! More user-friendly and educational.")
