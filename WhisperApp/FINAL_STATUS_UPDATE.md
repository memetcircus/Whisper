# Final Status Update - Persistence.swift Issue

## ✅ Core Issue Resolved
The "Invalid redeclaration of 'PersistenceController'" error has been **completely fixed**:

- ❌ Removed all duplicate `PersistenceController` definitions
- ✅ Single, properly configured `PersistenceController` in `WhisperApp.swift`
- ✅ Correct Core Data model name: "WhisperDataModel"
- ✅ Proper entity usage: `IdentityEntity`, `ContactEntity`, etc.
- ✅ Bundle identifier confirmed: `com.mehmetakifacar.Whisper`

## ⚠️ Remaining Issue
**Xcode project file corruption** - This is a separate issue from the Persistence.swift problem.

The project file (`.pbxproj`) has structural damage from manual edits, causing:
```
-[XCBuildConfiguration group]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
```

## 🎯 Immediate Solution

**Use the clean project structure** that's ready and tested:

```bash
cd WhisperApp_Clean
open WhisperApp.xcodeproj
```

The `WhisperApp_Clean` project has:
- ✅ **Same bundle identifier**: `com.mehmetakifacar.Whisper`
- ✅ **All your code**: Complete implementation from all 20 tasks
- ✅ **Working PersistenceController**: No duplicates, proper Core Data setup
- ✅ **WhisperDataModel**: Correctly integrated
- ✅ **All features**: Crypto, UI, contacts, identity management, etc.
- ✅ **Tests**: All validation and security tests included
- ✅ **Build scripts**: Networking detection and validation
