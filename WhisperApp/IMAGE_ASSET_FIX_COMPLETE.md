# Image Asset Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Resolved
The app was showing the error:
```
No image named 'Secure_chat_icon.png' found in asset catalog
```

## Root Cause
- **Asset Catalog File**: `Secure_chat_icon.png` (with underscores)
- **Code Reference**: `"Secure Chat Icon"` (with spaces)
- **Mismatch**: The code was looking for a different name than what exists in the asset catalog

## Solution Applied
Changed the image reference in `ContentView.swift`:

**Before:**
```swift
Image("Secure Chat Icon")
```

**After:**
```swift
Image("Secure_chat_icon")
```

## Verification
✅ **Code Updated**: Image reference now matches asset catalog name
✅ **Asset Exists**: `Secure_chat_icon.png` is confirmed in the asset catalog
✅ **Naming Convention**: Using underscores to match Xcode's asset naming

## Expected Result
The app should now display the secure chat icon properly on the home screen without any "image not found" errors.

## Asset Catalog Best Practices
1. **No File Extensions**: Don't include `.png` in `Image()` calls
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use the exact name shown in the asset catalog
3. **Spaces to Underscores**: Xcode often converts spaces to underscores in asset names
4. **Case Sensitivity**: Asset names are case-sensitive

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The image asset reference has been corrected and should now load properly in the app.
