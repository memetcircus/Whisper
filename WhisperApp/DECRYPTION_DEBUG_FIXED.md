# 🔍 Decryption Debug - Fixed and Ready

## ✅ Build Errors Fixed

The string multiplication syntax errors have been fixed:
- Changed `"=" * 80` to `String(repeating: "=", count: 80)`
- All debug logging syntax is now correct

## 🚀 How to Get Debug Logs

### 1. Build the Project
Since the Xcode project file seems corrupted, try these options:

**Option A: Clean and Rebuild**
```bash
# In Xcode:
# Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘+Shift+K)
# Then Product → Build (⌘+B)
```

**Option B: Use the Clean Project**
```bash
# Use the WhisperApp_Clean project instead
cd WhisperApp_Clean
# Open WhisperApp_Clean.xcodeproj in Xcode
```

### 2. Run and Get Logs
1. **Open Xcode Console** (⌘+Shift+C)
2. **Run the app** in iOS Simulator
3. **Go to Decrypt tab**
4. **Paste your encrypted message**
5. **Tap "Decrypt Message"**

### 3. Expected Debug Output

You'll see formatted logs like this:

```

```

## 🎯 What to Look For

### Most Likely Issue: Identity Mismatch
If you see:
```
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ❌ IDENTITY MISMATCH - No matching identity found!
```

**This means:**
- Akif encrypted to RKID: `0eXcjEuWHjw=`
- Tugba's phone has different RKIDs: `ABC123xyz=`, `XYZ789abc=`
- **None match** → Decryption impossible

### Solutions:

1. **Export/Import Identity**
   - Export Tugba's identity from Akif's phone
   - Import it on Tugba's phone
   - Or vice versa

2. **Use Same Identity Name**
   - Both phones create identity with same name
   - Exchange public keys via QR codes

3. **Raw Key Test**
   - Use "Raw Key" mode in Compose
   - Encrypt to Tugba's actual public key
   - This bypasses identity matching

## 📋 Copy This Debug Log

**Run the decryption and copy the entire section between the `====` lines.**

Paste it here and I'll tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it!

The debug output will clearly show:
- Which identity the message was encrypted to
- Which identities exist on Tugba's phone  
- Whether there's a match or mismatch
- Exactly where the decryption fails

This will give us a definitive answer about what's causing the "Cryptographic operation failed" error.
