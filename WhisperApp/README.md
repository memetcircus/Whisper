![Whisper Logo](WhisperApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon.png)

**Whisper** is a privacy-focused iOS application that provides military-grade end-to-end encryption for secure communication. Built with SwiftUI and leveraging industry-standard cryptographic protocols, Whisper ensures your messages remain private and secure.

## üîê What is Whisper?

Whisper is a **serverless, peer-to-peer encryption app** that allows users to:
- Encrypt messages locally on their device
- Share encrypted content via QR codes
- Decrypt messages received from trusted contacts
- Manage cryptographic identities with biometric protection
- Verify contact authenticity through secure fingerprint verification

**Key Philosophy**: Your data never leaves your device unencrypted. No servers, no cloud storage, no third-party access.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Advantages

### **Cryptographic Strength**
- **Military-grade encryption**: Uses the same cryptographic primitives as Signal Protocol
- **Post-quantum resistant**: Curve25519 provides strong security against future quantum attacks
- **Authenticated encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 prevents tampering and ensures message integrity
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Compromised keys cannot decrypt past messages

### **Privacy Protection**
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: No servers can access your data
- **Local-only processing**: All encryption/decryption happens on your device
- **No metadata collection**: No tracking, analytics, or user profiling
- **Offline operation**: Works completely without internet connectivity

### **Attack Resistance**
- **Man-in-the-middle protection**: SAS verification prevents impersonation
- **Replay attack prevention**: Timestamp validation ensures message freshness
- **Traffic analysis resistance**: Message padding obscures content patterns
- **Key compromise recovery**: Automatic key rotation limits damage from breaches

### **Device Security**
- **Biometric protection**: Face ID guards access to encryption keys
- **Secure Enclave integration**: Keys stored in iOS hardware security module
- **App sandboxing**: iOS security model isolates app data
- **Secure deletion**: Cryptographic erasure of sensitive data

### **Compliance & Standards**
- **FIPS-compliant algorithms**: Uses government-approved cryptographic standards
- **Open-source cryptography**: Based on well-audited, public algorithms
- **No proprietary crypto**: Avoids custom encryption schemes
- **Industry best practices**: Follows OWASP and NIST security guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Cryptographic Stack**
```
Application Layer (SwiftUI)
    ‚Üì
Whisper Core (Encryption Engine)
    ‚Üì
CryptoKit (Apple's Cryptography Framework)
    ‚Üì
Secure Enclave (Hardware Security)
```

### **Key Components**
- **CryptoEngine**: Core encryption/decryption operations
- **IdentityManager**: Cryptographic identity lifecycle management
- **ContactManager**: Secure contact and key management
- **BiometricService**: Face ID integration and key protection
- **QRCodeService**: QR code generation and scanning
- **EnvelopeProcessor**: Message packaging and validation

### **Security Policies**
- **Verified contacts only**: Messages can only be sent to verified contacts
- **Automatic key rotation**: Keys rotate based on time or usage thresholds
- **Biometric gating**: Optional Face ID requirement for all operations
- **Secure storage**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `WhisperApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on iOS device (Face ID requires physical device)

### **First Use**
1. Accept the legal disclaimer
2. Create your first cryptographic identity
3. Set up Face ID protection (recommended)
4. Add contacts via QR code exchange
5. **Verify each contact using SAS words** (critical security step)
6. Start encrypting messages!

### **Basic Workflow**
1. **Add Contact**: Exchange public keys via QR codes
2. **Verify Contact**: Use SAS (Short Authentication String) words to confirm identity
3. **Compose**: Write your message and select verified recipient
4. **Encrypt**: App generates encrypted QR code
5. **Share**: Send QR code via any channel (email, messaging, etc.)
6. **Decrypt**: Recipient scans QR code to decrypt message

### **SAS Verification Process**
After adding a contact, both parties must verify each other using SAS words:
1. App generates 5 unique verification words for each contact
2. Compare these words with your contact through a secure channel (in person, phone call)
3. Both parties confirm the words match exactly
4. Only verified contacts can send/receive encrypted messages
5. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures authentic communication
