# Compose UX Improvements - Final

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redundant Copy Button
**Problem**: The compose view had a separate "Copy" button even though the Share sheet already provides a Copy option, creating redundant functionality.

**Solution**: Removed the standalone Copy button from the post-encryption action buttons.

### 2. Unwanted Auto-Dismiss Behavior  
**Problem**: When users clicked Share and then canceled the share sheet, the entire compose view would automatically close, losing their work and forcing them to start over.

**Solution**: Removed the `onDismiss` auto-close behavior from the share sheet.

## Changes Applied

### Before:
```swift
// Three buttons: Share, QR Code, Copy
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    Button("Share") { ... }
    Button("QR Code") { ... }  
    Button("Copy") { ... }     // ← Redundant
}

// Auto-dismiss on share sheet close
.sheet(isPresented: $viewModel.showingShareSheet, onDismiss: {
    dismiss()  // ← Unwanted behavior
}) { ... }
```

### After:
```swift
// Two buttons: Share, QR Code only
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    Button("Share") { ... }
    Button("QR Code") { ... }
    // Copy button removed - available in share sheet
}

// No auto-dismiss behavior
.sheet(isPresented: $viewModel.showingShareSheet) { ... }
```

## User Experience Impact

### Copy Functionality:
- **Before**: Redundant Copy button + Copy option in share sheet
- **After**: Copy available only in share sheet (cleaner, no duplication)
- **Benefit**: Reduced UI clutter, consistent with iOS patterns

### Share Sheet Behavior:
- **Before**: Cancel share → Compose view closes → User loses work
- **After**: Cancel share → Stay in compose view → User keeps work
- **Benefit**: Better user control, no accidental data loss

### Button Layout:
- **Before**: 3 buttons (Share, QR Code, Copy)
- **After**: 2 buttons (Share, QR Code)
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused interface

## Technical Implementation

### Copy Button Removal:
- Removed `Button(LocalizationHelper.Encrypt.copy)` from `actionButtonsSection`
- Removed associated `copyToClipboard()` call
- Copy functionality still available through iOS share sheet

### Share Sheet Behavior:
- Removed `onDismiss` parameter from `.sheet()` modifier
- Compose view now persists after share sheet dismissal
- Users maintain control over when to close compose view

## User Flow Improvements

### Encryption → Share Flow:
1. **Encrypt message** ✓
2. **Tap Share** ✓  
3. **Choose sharing option** (including Copy) ✓
4. **Cancel or complete sharing** ✓
5. **Return to compose view** ✓ (NEW: stays open)
6. **User decides when to close** ✓ (NEW: user control)

### Benefits:
- **No accidental closure**: Users won't lose their encrypted message
- **Multiple sharing attempts**: Can try different share options
- **Better workflow**: Natural iOS sharing patterns
- **Reduced frustration**: No need to re-encrypt if share is canceled

## Files Modified
