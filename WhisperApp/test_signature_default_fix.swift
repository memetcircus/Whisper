print("âœ… ISSUE IDENTIFIED:")
print("   - 'Include Signature' toggle was OFF by default")
print("   - Users had to manually enable it for signed messages")
print("   - This led to unsigned messages showing 'Unknown' attribution")

print("\nâœ… FIX APPLIED:")
print("   - Changed default value from 'false' to 'true'")
print("   - Location: ComposeViewModel.swift line 31")
print("   - Property: @Published var includeSignature: Bool = true")

print("\nðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULT:")
print("   - Compose view now shows signature toggle ON by default")
print("   - Messages will be signed by default (better security)")
print("   - Attribution will show sender name instead of 'Unknown'")

print("\nðŸ“± TEST STEPS:")
print("   1. Open Compose Message view")
print("   2. Check 'Include Signature' toggle - should be ON")
print("   3. Create and encrypt a message")
print("   4. Decrypt on recipient device")
print("   5. Attribution should show sender name (e.g., 'Akif')")

print("\nðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS:")
print("   - Default signature: ON (true)")
print("   - User can still toggle OFF if desired")
print("   - Policy requirements still enforced")
print("   - Better security by default")

print("\nðŸ’¡ BENEFITS:")
print("   - Better security posture (signed by default)")
print("   - Clear sender attribution")
print("   - Matches user expectations")
print("   - Reduces confusion about message origin")
