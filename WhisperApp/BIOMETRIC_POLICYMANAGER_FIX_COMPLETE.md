# Biometric PolicyManager Fix - Complete

## Problem
The BiometricSettingsViewModel had the same build error as SettingsViewModel:
- `policyManager` was declared as `let` but the `toggleBiometricSigning()` method was trying to modify its properties
- This caused the compiler error: "Cannot assign to property: 'policyManager' is a 'let' constant"

## Root Cause
Swift compiler interprets attempts to modify properties of a `let` reference as trying to modify the reference itself, even when the properties are mutable. This is the same issue we encountered and fixed in SettingsViewModel.

## Solution Applied
Changed the `policyManager` declaration from `let` to `var` to match the fix applied in SettingsViewModel:

### Before ‚ùå
```swift
private let policyManager: PolicyManager
```

### After ‚úÖ
```swift
private var policyManager: PolicyManager
```

## Code Changes

### BiometricSettingsViewModel.swift
```swift
// Line 16: Changed declaration
private var policyManager: PolicyManager  // was: private let policyManager: PolicyManager

// This allows the toggleBiometricSigning method to work correctly:
func toggleBiometricSigning() {
    policyManager.biometricGatedSigning = !policyManager.biometricGatedSigning
    biometricSigningEnabled = policyManager.biometricGatedSigning
}
```

## Consistency Achieved
Both ViewModels now use the same pattern:
- ‚úÖ **SettingsViewModel**: `private var policyManager: SettingsPolicyManager`
- ‚úÖ **BiometricSettingsViewModel**: `private var policyManager: PolicyManager`

## Impact
- **Build Errors**: Resolved compilation errors in BiometricSettingsViewModel
- **Functionality**: `toggleBiometricSigning()` method now works correctly
- **Consistency**: Both settings ViewModels follow the same pattern
- **UX**: Biometric signing toggle will now properly update the policy

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Settings/BiometricSettingsViewModel.swift` - Changed `let` to `var` for policyManager

## Verification
- ‚úÖ policyManager correctly declared as `var`
- ‚úÖ toggleBiometricSigning method can modify policyManager properties
- ‚úÖ Consistent with SettingsViewModel implementation
- ‚úÖ No more "cannot assign to property" errors

## Status
üü¢ **COMPLETE** - BiometricSettingsViewModel policyManager fix applied successfully, matching the pattern used in SettingsViewModel.
