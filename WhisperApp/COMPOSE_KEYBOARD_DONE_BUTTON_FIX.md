# Compose Keyboard Done Button Fix

## Issue Description
In the compose message screen, when users start typing in the message text field, the keyboard appears but there's no visible "Done" button to dismiss it. This creates a poor user experience where users can't easily dismiss the keyboard after typing their message.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a toolbar configuration conflict in SwiftUI. The TextEditor had a keyboard toolbar with a "Done" button, but it was being overridden by the navigation toolbar on the parent NavigationView.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Keyboard Toolbar to Parent View
- Moved the `ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard)` from the TextEditor to the parent NavigationView's toolbar
- This ensures the keyboard toolbar is not overridden by other toolbar configurations

### 2. Added Conditional Display Logic
- The "Done" button now only appears when the message field is focused (`isMessageFieldFocused`)
- This prevents the button from showing when other text fields might be active

### 3. Removed Duplicate Configuration
- Removed the duplicate `.toolbar` modifier from the TextEditor
- Kept only the `.focused($isMessageFieldFocused)` modifier on the TextEditor

## Code Changes

### Before:
```swift
TextEditor(...)
    .focused($isMessageFieldFocused)
    .toolbar {
        ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard) {
            Spacer()
            Button("Done") {
                isMessageFieldFocused = false
            }
            .fontWeight(.semibold)
        }
    }
```

### After:
```swift
// In NavigationView toolbar
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarLeading) {
        // Cancel button...
    }
    
    // Keyboard toolbar for message input
    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard) {
        Spacer()
        if isMessageFieldFocused {
            Button("Done") {
                isMessageFieldFocused = false
            }
            .fontWeight(.semibold)
        }
    }
}

// TextEditor simplified
TextEditor(...)
    .focused($isMessageFieldFocused)
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visible Done Button**: Users now see a "Done" button on the keyboard when typing messages
2. **Easy Keyboard Dismissal**: Tapping "Done" properly dismisses the keyboard
3. **Conditional Display**: The button only appears when relevant (message field focused)
4. **Consistent Styling**: The "Done" button has semibold font weight for better visibility

## Testing
- ✅ Keyboard toolbar appears when message field is focused
- ✅ "Done" button dismisses keyboard correctly
- ✅ No duplicate toolbar configurations
- ✅ Proper FocusState management
- ✅ Button styling is consistent

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/WhisperApp/UI/Compose/ComposeView.swift`

This fix ensures users have a smooth typing experience in the compose message screen with proper keyboard management.
