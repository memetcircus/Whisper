# Navigation Title Redundancy Fix

## Problem
The contact detail view displayed a redundant navigation title at the top center of the screen. Since the contact name was already prominently displayed in the content area, the navigation title created unnecessary duplication and visual clutter.

## Solution
Removed the redundant navigation title by setting it to an empty string while maintaining the navigation bar structure for the Done button and menu.

### Changes Made

1. **Set Empty Navigation Title**
   - Added `.navigationTitle("")` to remove the title text
   - Used `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)` for minimal space usage

2. **Maintained Navigation Functionality**
   - Kept toolbar with Done button and menu
   - Preserved all navigation interactions
   - Contact name remains clearly visible in content area

### Before vs After

**Before:**
```swift
// No explicit navigation title configuration
// Default behavior showed contact name in navigation bar
```

**After:**
```swift
.navigationTitle("")
.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
.toolbar {
    // Done button and menu remain
}
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates redundant title display
- ✅ Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- ✅ More space for content
- ✅ Maintains all navigation functionality
- ✅ Contact name still clearly visible in content area
- ✅ Consistent with minimal design principles

## User Experience Impact
- **Reduced Visual Clutter**: No duplicate contact name display
- **Better Space Utilization**: More room for contact information
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Minimal navigation bar with essential controls only
- **Maintained Functionality**: All buttons and interactions preserved

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Contacts/ContactDetailView.swift`

## Testing
Run `./test_navigation_title_removal.swift` to validate the navigation title removal.

## Design Rationale
The contact name is already prominently displayed in the content area with appropriate styling. Having it also appear in the navigation bar creates unnecessary redundancy and takes up valuable screen space. By removing the navigation title, we create a cleaner, more focused interface while maintaining all essential functionality.
