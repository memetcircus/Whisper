# QR Coordinator Auto-Dismiss Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The QR scanner was auto-dismissing the DecryptView after successful scans, preventing users from pressing the "Decrypt Message" button.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
From the logs, we identified that:
```
🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: Scanner sheet dismissed
🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: showingContactPreview = false
🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: showingDecryptView = false
🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: Calling onDismiss() - this might dismiss the decrypt view!
```

The QR coordinator was calling `onDismiss()` after **every** scanner dismissal, including successful scans.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented
Added a `successfulScan` flag to track when a QR code was successfully scanned:

### 1. Added State Variable
```swift
@State private var successfulScan = false
```

### 2. Updated Dismiss Logic
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingScanner, onDismiss: {
    // Only dismiss the coordinator if:
    // 1. No other views are showing AND
    // 2. There was no successful scan (user cancelled or error occurred)
    if !showingContactPreview && !showingDecryptView && !successfulScan {
        print("🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: Calling onDismiss() - user cancelled or error occurred")
        onDismiss()
    } else {
        print("🔍 QR_COORDINATOR: NOT calling onDismiss() - successful scan or other views showing")
    }
})
```

### 3. Set Flag on Successful Scans
```swift
case .publicKeyBundle:
    successfulScan = true
    showingContactPreview = true
case .encryptedMessage(let envelope):
    successfulScan = true
    onMessageDecrypted(envelope)
```

### 4. Reset Flag on New Scans
```swift
case .authorized:
    successfulScan = false // Reset flag when starting new scan
    showingScanner = true
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Successful QR Scan Flow:
1. **User scans QR code** → `successfulScan = true`
2. **Scanner sheet dismisses** → Checks `successfulScan` flag
3. **Since successful scan** → Does NOT call `onDismiss()` → DecryptView stays open
4. **User can press "Decrypt Message" button** → Decryption proceeds normally

### User Cancellation Flow:
1. **User cancels scan** → `successfulScan = false` (default)
2. **Scanner sheet dismisses** → Checks `successfulScan` flag  
3. **Since no successful scan** → Calls `onDismiss()` → Properly dismisses

## 🧪 Testing Results
All tests passed:
- ✅ successfulScan state variable exists
- ✅ successfulScan used in dismiss logic
- ✅ successfulScan set for public key scans
- ✅ successfulScan set for encrypted message scans
- ✅ successfulScan reset on scan start
- ✅ Debug logging includes successfulScan

## 🎉 Expected Behavior
Now when you scan a QR code:
1. ✅ **QR scan succeeds** 
2. ✅ **Success message appears**
3. ✅ **DecryptView stays open** (no auto-dismiss!)
4. ✅ **User can press "Decrypt Message" button**
5. ✅ **Decrypted message is displayed**

The DecryptView will now properly stay open and wait for user interaction after successful QR scans! 🎯
