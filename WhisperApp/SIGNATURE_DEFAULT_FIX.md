# 🔐 Include Signature Default Fix

## 📱 **Issue Description**
The "Include Signature" toggle in the Compose Message view was **OFF by default**, requiring users to manually enable it for signed messages. This led to:
- Most messages being sent unsigned
- Attribution showing "Unknown" instead of sender name
- Poor security posture by default

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
In `ComposeViewModel.swift`, the `includeSignature` property was initialized to `false`:

```swift
@Published var includeSignature: Bool = false  // ❌ OFF by default
```

## ✅ **Fix Implementation**

### Changed Default Value
```swift
// BEFORE (Poor UX)
@Published var includeSignature: Bool = false

// AFTER (Better UX & Security)
@Published var includeSignature: Bool = true  // ✅ ON by default
```

### Location
- **File**: `WhisperApp/WhisperApp/UI/Compose/ComposeViewModel.swift`
- **Line**: 31
- **Change**: Single line modification

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### Before Fix
- **Default State**: Include Signature OFF
- **User Action**: Must manually enable signature
- **Message Type**: Unsigned by default
- **Attribution**: Shows "Unknown"

### After Fix
- **Default State**: Include Signature ON ✅
- **User Action**: Can optionally disable if desired
- **Message Type**: Signed by default
- **Attribution**: Shows sender name (e.g., "Akif")

## 📱 **Testing Steps**

1. **Open Compose View**: Navigate to message composition
2. **Check Toggle State**: "Include Signature" should be ON by default
3. **Create Message**: Compose and encrypt a message
4. **Verify Encryption**: Message should be signed
5. **Test Decryption**: Decrypt on recipient device
6. **Check Attribution**: Should show sender name instead of "Unknown"

## 🔧 **Technical Benefits**

### Security Improvements
- **Better Default Security**: Messages signed by default
- **Authentication**: Recipients can verify sender identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Signed messages provide proof of origin

### User Experience
- **Clear Attribution**: Recipients see who sent the message
- **Reduced Confusion**: No more "Unknown" sender messages
- **Intuitive Behavior**: Matches user expectations for secure messaging

### Flexibility Maintained
- **User Choice**: Can still disable signature if desired
- **Policy Enforcement**: Required signatures still enforced
- **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality

## 💡 **Why This Matters**

### Security Best Practices
- **Secure by Default**: Better security posture out of the box
- **Identity Verification**: Recipients can trust message origin
- **Audit Trail**: Signed messages provide accountability

### User Adoption
- **Reduced Friction**: Users don't need to remember to enable signatures
- **Better Experience**: Clear sender identification
- **Trust Building**: Consistent signed communication builds confidence

## 🎉 **Summary**

This simple one-line change significantly improves both security and user experience:

- **Security**: Messages are signed by default
- **UX**: Clear sender attribution instead of "Unknown"
- **Flexibility**: Users can still opt out if needed
- **Consistency**: Matches expectations for secure messaging apps

The fix ensures that Whisper provides strong security defaults while maintaining user choice and flexibility.
