# QR Code Sharing Security Analysis

## 🔐 Security Assessment: Sharing QR Codes via WhatsApp

### ✅ SECURE - Public Key Distribution
Sharing Whisper QR codes via WhatsApp (or any channel) is **cryptographically secure** because:

1. **Public Keys Are Public**: QR codes contain public keys, which are designed to be shared openly
2. **No Private Information**: No private keys, passwords, or secrets are exposed
3. **Authentication via SAS**: The SAS word verification provides authentication
4. **Man-in-the-Middle Protection**: SAS verification prevents MITM attacks

### 🔍 What's in the QR Code?
```
- Public X25519 key (encryption)
- Public Ed25519 key (signing) 
- Fingerprint (derived from public key)
- Display name
- Key version & creation date
- NO private keys or secrets
```

### 🛡️ Security Properties Maintained

#### 1. Confidentiality
- ✅ No secrets exposed in QR code
- ✅ Future messages remain encrypted end-to-end

#### 2. Authentication  
- ✅ SAS word verification prevents impersonation
- ✅ Fingerprint verification available as backup

#### 3. Integrity
- ✅ QR code tampering would be detected during SAS verification
- ✅ Invalid public keys would fail cryptographic operations

### 📱 Real-World Comparison
This is similar to how other secure messengers work:
- **Signal**: Shares safety numbers via any channel
- **WhatsApp**: Shares QR codes for verification
- **Telegram**: Shares public key fingerprints

### ⚠️ Threat Model Considerations

#### Threats Mitigated:
- ✅ **Eavesdropping**: Public keys are meant to be public
- ✅ **Man-in-the-Middle**: SAS verification detects this
- ✅ **Impersonation**: SAS words must match between parties

#### Residual Risks (Low Impact):
- 📊 **Metadata Exposure**: Reveals that two parties are establishing contact
- 🕐 **Timing Analysis**: Shows when contact was established
- 👥 **Social Graph**: Could reveal relationships if intercepted at scale

### 🎯 Recommendation: SECURE TO SHARE
**Verdict**: It is **cryptographically safe** to share Whisper QR codes via WhatsApp or any communication channel.

**Best Practice**: Always verify SAS words in person or via a trusted secondary channel for maximum security.
