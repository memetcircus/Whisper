# Identity Timestamp UX Improvement

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Issue**: Multiple key rotations on the same day created identities with identical names, making them indistinguishable:

```
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Same name!
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Same name!
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Same name!
```

Users couldn't tell which identity was which when rotating keys multiple times per day.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Precise Timestamp in Identity Names**
**Before**: Date only (`2025-09-09`)
**After**: Date + Time (`2025-09-09 14:30:25`)

```swift
// Updated rotation logic
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"  // ← Added time
let dateString = dateFormatter.string(from: Date())
let newName = "\(baseName) (Rotated \(dateString))"
```

### **2. Enhanced UI with Visual Hierarchy**
Created `IdentityNameView` that displays:
- **Base name** in headline font (prominent)
- **Rotation timestamp** in small caption font (subtle)

**Visual Layout**:
```
Project A                    ← Large, prominent
Rotated 2025-09-09 14:30:25  ← Small, subtle
```

### **3. Backward Compatibility**
Updated regex pattern to handle both old and new formats:
```regex
 \(Rotated \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}( \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})?\)
```
- Matches: `(Rotated 2025-09-09)` (old format)
- Matches: `(Rotated 2025-09-09 14:30:25)` (new format)

## 🎯 Results

### **Before Fix**:
```
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Identical names
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Can't distinguish
Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)  ← Which is which?
```

### **After Fix**:
```
Project A                       ← Clean base name
Rotated 2025-09-09 10:15:30    ← Precise timestamp

Project A                       ← Clean base name  
Rotated 2025-09-09 14:22:45    ← Different time

Project A                       ← Clean base name
Rotated 2025-09-09 16:08:12    ← Unique timestamp
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### **Visual Hierarchy**:
1. **Primary**: Base identity name (large, bold)
2. **Secondary**: Rotation timestamp (small, muted)

### **Benefits**:
- ✅ **Unique Names**: Every rotation has a unique timestamp
- ✅ **Clean Display**: Base name remains prominent
- ✅ **Precise Tracking**: Exact time of key rotation
- ✅ **Better UX**: Easy to distinguish between rotations
- ✅ **Space Efficient**: Timestamp doesn't clutter the main name

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **IdentityNameView Implementation**:
```swift
struct IdentityNameView: View {
    let name: String
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 2) {
            Text(baseName)
                .font(.headline)        // ← Prominent
            
            if let timestamp = rotationTimestamp {
                Text("Rotated \(timestamp)")
                    .font(.caption2)    // ← Small font
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)  // ← Muted color
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Smart Parsing**:
- **Extracts base name**: "Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09 14:30:25)" → "Project A"
- **Extracts timestamp**: "Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09 14:30:25)" → "2025-09-09 14:30:25"
- **Handles legacy format**: "Project A (Rotated 2025-09-09)" → "2025-09-09"

## ✅ User Experience

### **Clear Identity Distinction**:
Users can now easily:
- **Identify the base identity** (prominent name)
- **See when keys were rotated** (precise timestamp)
- **Distinguish between multiple rotations** (unique times)
- **Understand the chronology** (time-based ordering)

### **Professional Appearance**:
- Clean, uncluttered primary names
- Subtle, informative timestamps
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Mobile-friendly layout

The identity management now provides **precise tracking** with **clean visual design**! 🎉
