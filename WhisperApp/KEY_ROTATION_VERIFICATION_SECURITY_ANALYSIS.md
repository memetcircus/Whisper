# Key Rotation Verification Security Analysis

## 🔐 **The Critical Security Question**

**Scenario**: 
- Tugba has an identity that Akif has verified (trusted)
- Tugba rotates her keys (creates new identity, archives old one)
- **Should Akif need to re-verify Tugba's new rotated identity?**

## ✅ **Answer: YES - Re-verification is MANDATORY for Security**

### **🚨 Why Re-verification is Essential**

#### **1. Cryptographic Independence**
- **New Keys = New Trust Relationship**: The rotated identity has completely different X25519/Ed25519 key pairs
- **No Cryptographic Link**: There's no mathematical relationship between old and new keys
- **Previous Verification Invalid**: Akif's verification was for the OLD keys, not the new ones

#### **2. Man-in-the-Middle Attack Prevention**
```
Scenario: Attacker intercepts key rotation
1. Tugba rotates keys legitimately
2. Attacker intercepts and replaces with their own keys
3. Without re-verification, Akif trusts attacker's keys
4. All future communication is compromised
```

#### **3. Forward Secrecy Principle**
- Key rotation intentionally breaks cryptographic continuity
- Trust should NOT automatically transfer between key generations
- Each key pair must establish its own trust relationship

#### **4. Zero-Trust Security Model**
- Never assume identity continuity across key changes
- Each new cryptographic material requires independent verification
- Trust is tied to specific keys, not abstract identities

## 🔧 **Current System Analysis**

### **Existing Trust Levels**
```swift
enum TrustLevel: String, CaseIterable {
    case unverified = "unverified"  // ← New rotated keys should start here
    case verified = "verified"      // ← Only after re-verification
    case revoked = "revoked"        // ← For compromised keys
}
```

### **Key Rotation Method**
```swift
func withKeyRotation(newX25519Key: Data, newEd25519Key: Data? = nil) throws -> Contact {
    // Adds new keys to keyHistory but doesn't reset trust level
    // ❌ SECURITY ISSUE: Trust level should be reset to .unverified
}
```

## 🚨 **Security Vulnerability Identified**

The current `withKeyRotation` method **does NOT reset the trust level**. This means:
- ❌ Rotated keys inherit the trust level of old keys
- ❌ No re-verification is required
- ❌ Potential security vulnerability

## ✅ **Recommended Security Implementation**

### **1. Reset Trust Level on Key Rotation**
```swift
func withKeyRotation(newX25519Key: Data, newEd25519Key: Data? = nil) throws -> Contact {
    let newKeyHistory = try KeyHistoryEntry(
        keyVersion: keyVersion + 1,
        x25519PublicKey: newX25519Key,
        ed25519PublicKey: newEd25519Key
    )

    let updatedKeyHistory = keyHistory + [newKeyHistory]
    
    return Contact(
        id: id,
        displayName: displayName,
        x25519PublicKey: newX25519Key,        // ← New keys
        ed25519PublicKey: newEd25Key,         // ← New keys
        fingerprint: try Contact.generateFingerprint(from: newX25519Key), // ← New fingerprint
        shortFingerprint: Contact.generateShortFingerprint(from: newFingerprint),
        sasWords: Contact.generateSASWords(from: newFingerprint),
        rkid: Data(newFingerprint.suffix(8)),
        trustLevel: .unverified,              // ← RESET TO UNVERIFIED
        isBlocked: isBlocked,
        keyVersion: keyVersion + 1,
        keyHistory: updatedKeyHistory,
        createdAt: createdAt,
        lastSeenAt: lastSeenAt,
        note: note
    )
}
```

### **2. Key Rotation Warning System**
```swift
func needsReVerification() -> Bool {
    return keyHistory.count > 0 && trustLevel == .unverified
}

var keyRotationWarning: String? {
    if needsReVerification() {
        return "This contact has rotated their keys and needs re-verification for secure communication."
    }
    return nil
}
```

### **3. UI Indicators**
- **Orange Warning Badge**: "Key Rotated - Verify Required"
- **Blocked Encryption**: Prevent sending to unverified rotated contacts
- **Clear Messaging**: Explain why re-verification is needed

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **When Tugba Rotates Keys:**
1. **Akif's Contact List**: Tugba's contact shows "Unverified" with warning
2. **Warning Message**: "Tugba has rotated their keys. Re-verify to continue secure communication."
3. **Verification Required**: Akif must verify new fingerprint/SAS words
4. **Trust Restored**: Only after verification, contact becomes "Verified" again

### **Security Benefits:**
- ✅ **Prevents MITM attacks** during key rotation
- ✅ **Enforces cryptographic hygiene**
- ✅ **Maintains zero-trust principles**
- ✅ **Protects against key substitution**

## 📱 **Implementation Priority**

### **High Priority Security Fix:**
1. **Modify `withKeyRotation`** to reset trust level to `.unverified`
2. **Add UI warnings** for rotated but unverified contacts
3. **Block encryption** to unverified rotated contacts
4. **Add re-verification flow** in contact details

### **User Education:**
- Explain why re-verification is necessary
- Show clear indicators for rotated keys
- Guide users through verification process
- Emphasize security benefits

## 🔒 **Security Conclusion**

**YES, Akif MUST re-verify Tugba's rotated identity.** This is not optional - it's a fundamental security requirement for:

1. **Preventing man-in-the-middle attacks**
2. **Maintaining cryptographic integrity**
3. **Following zero-trust principles**
4. **Ensuring forward secrecy**

The current system has a **security vulnerability** by not resetting trust levels during key rotation. This should be fixed immediately to maintain the security guarantees of the Whisper protocol.

**Bottom Line**: New keys = New verification required. No exceptions.
