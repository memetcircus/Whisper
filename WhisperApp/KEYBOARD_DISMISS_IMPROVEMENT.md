# Keyboard Dismiss Improvement

## Issue Fixed
The TextEditor in the compose message screen had no easy way to dismiss the keyboard after typing, making it difficult for users to close the keyboard and continue with other actions.

## Root Cause
TextEditor in SwiftUI doesn't automatically provide a "Done" button like UITextField does. Users had to:
- Tap outside the text area (not always intuitive)
- Use gesture-based dismissal (not discoverable)
- Or struggle to find a way to close the keyboard

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Focus State Management
```swift
@FocusState private var isMessageFieldFocused: Bool
```

### 2. Connected TextEditor to Focus State
```swift
TextEditor(...)
    .focused($isMessageFieldFocused)
```

### 3. Added Keyboard Toolbar with Done Button
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard) {
        Spacer()
        Button("Done") {
            isMessageFieldFocused = false
        }
        .fontWeight(.semibold)
    }
}
```

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- ❌ No obvious way to dismiss keyboard
- ❌ Users had to tap outside text area
- ❌ Frustrating text input experience
- ❌ Non-standard iOS behavior

### After:
- ✅ Clear "Done" button in keyboard toolbar
- ✅ Intuitive keyboard dismissal
- ✅ Standard iOS text input pattern
- ✅ Better user control over input flow

## Technical Implementation

### Focus State:
- `@FocusState` tracks whether the TextEditor is focused
- When `true`, keyboard is shown
- When `false`, keyboard is dismissed

### Keyboard Toolbar:
- `ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard)` adds items to keyboard toolbar
- `Spacer()` pushes Done button to the right side
- `Button("Done")` provides clear dismissal action

### Button Styling:
- `.fontWeight(.semibold)` makes button prominent
- Positioned on right side (iOS standard)
- Clear, actionable text

## User Flow Improvement

### Text Input Flow:
1. **Tap TextEditor** → Keyboard appears with Done button
2. **Type message** → Done button remains visible
3. **Tap Done** → Keyboard dismisses cleanly
4. **Continue with other actions** → Smooth workflow

### Benefits:
- **Discoverable**: Done button is clearly visible
- **Standard**: Follows iOS design patterns
- **Efficient**: One-tap keyboard dismissal
- **Accessible**: Clear action for all users

## iOS Design Compliance
- **Keyboard Toolbar**: Standard iOS pattern for text input
- **Done Button**: Common iOS convention for dismissing keyboard
- **Right Alignment**: Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- **Semibold Font**: Appropriate emphasis for primary action

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Compose/ComposeView.swift`
  - Added `@FocusState` property
  - Added `.focused()` modifier to TextEditor
  - Added keyboard toolbar with Done button

## Validation
- ✅ FocusState properly declared and connected
- ✅ TextEditor responds to focus state changes
- ✅ Keyboard toolbar appears when typing
- ✅ Done button dismisses keyboard correctly
- ✅ Follows iOS design patterns
- ✅ Improves text input user experience

This improvement makes the text input experience much more user-friendly and aligns with standard iOS app behavior that users expect.
