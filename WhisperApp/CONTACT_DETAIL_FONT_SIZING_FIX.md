# Contact Detail View Font Sizing Fix

## Problem
The contact detail view had oversized fonts throughout the interface:
- Navigation title was too large (using `.large` display mode)
- Contact name was using `.title2` font (too prominent)
- Section headers were using `.headline` font (too large)
- Contact ID was using `.subheadline` font (too prominent)

## Solution
Applied appropriate font sizing hierarchy to improve readability and visual balance:

### Changes Made

1. **Navigation Title**
   - Changed from `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)` to `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)`
   - Creates a compact, non-intrusive header

2. **Contact Header Section**
   - Contact name: `.title2` → `.headline` (smaller but still prominent)
   - Contact ID: `.subheadline` → `.caption` (more subtle and appropriate)

3. **Section Headers**
   - All section headers: `.headline` → `.subheadline` with `.fontWeight(.semibold)`
   - Affects: Trust Status, Fingerprint, SAS Words, Technical Information, Key History

### Font Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)
```
Navigation Title (inline) - System managed size
Contact Name (.headline + .semibold) - Primary identifier
Section Headers (.subheadline + .semibold) - Clear organization
Body Text (.body) - Main content
Contact ID (.caption) - Secondary info
Captions (.caption/.caption2) - Supporting details
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- ✅ More space-efficient layout
