# Biometric Settings UX Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Title Too Large
**Problem:** The "Biometric Settings" title was displayed in large mode, making it oversized and taking up too much screen space.

**Solution:** Changed navigation bar title display mode from `.large` to `.inline` for a more compact, professional appearance.

**Code Change:**
```swift
// Before
.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)

// After  
.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
```

### 2. Enrollment Error Handling
**Problem:** When clicking "Enroll Signing Key", users received a generic error "Failed to enroll signing key: -25293" which was not user-friendly.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive error handling with specific, actionable error messages for common biometric issues.

**Improvements:**
- Added availability check before enrollment attempt
- Specific error messages for biometry not enrolled, lockout, and other common issues
- Clear instructions for users on how to resolve issues

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// Added specific error handling
catch BiometricError.biometryNotEnrolled {
    errorMessage = "Please enroll Face ID or Touch ID in Settings first"
} catch BiometricError.biometryLockout {
    errorMessage = "Biometric authentication is locked. Please unlock using passcode in Settings"
} catch BiometricError.enrollmentFailed(let status) {
    switch status {
    case -25293: // errSecBiometryLockout
        errorMessage = "Biometric authentication is locked. Please unlock using passcode in Settings"
    case -25291: // errSecBiometryNotAvailable
        errorMessage = "Please enroll Face ID or Touch ID in Settings first"
    default:
        errorMessage = "Failed to enroll signing key. Please try again"
    }
}
```

### 3. Error Message Font Size Too Small
**Problem:** Error messages were displayed in `.caption` font, making them difficult to read.

**Solution:** Changed error message font to `.body` size with proper text wrapping for better readability.

**Code Change:**
```swift
// Before
Text(errorMessage)
    .foregroundColor(.red)
    .font(.caption)

// After
Text(errorMessage)
    .foregroundColor(.red)
    .font(.body)
    .fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)
```

### 4. Enrollment Status Check Optimization
**Problem:** The enrollment status check was triggering biometric authentication prompts unnecessarily when the view appeared.

**Solution:** Replaced biometric authentication call with a simple keychain query that checks for key existence without requiring authentication.

**Code Change:**
```swift
// Before - triggered biometric prompt
let testData = "enrollment check".data(using: .utf8)!
_ = try await biometricService.sign(data: testData, keyId: testKeyId)

// After - simple keychain query
let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
    kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: "biometric-signing-\(keyTag)".data(using: .utf8)!,
    kSecMatchLimit as String: kSecMatchLimitOne
]
let status = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, nil)
isEnrolled = (status == errSecSuccess)
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Inline navigation title provides more screen space for content
2. **Better Error Messages**: Users now receive clear, actionable error messages instead of cryptic error codes
3. **Improved Readability**: Error messages are now properly sized and easy to read
4. **Smoother Navigation**: No unexpected biometric prompts when viewing the settings screen
5. **Better Guidance**: Specific instructions help users resolve common biometric setup issues

## Common Error Scenarios Handled

- **Biometry Not Enrolled**: "Please enroll Face ID or Touch ID in Settings first"
- **Biometry Locked Out**: "Biometric authentication is locked. Please unlock using passcode in Settings"
- **Device Not Supported**: "Biometric authentication is not available on this device"
- **General Enrollment Failure**: "Failed to enroll signing key. Please try again"
