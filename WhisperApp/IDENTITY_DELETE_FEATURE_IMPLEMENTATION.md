# Identity Delete Feature Implementation

## üéØ **Feature Added**

Added the ability to permanently delete identities from the Identity Management system.

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **1. Protocol Extension**
Added `deleteIdentity` method to the `IdentityManager` protocol:

```swift
/// Permanently deletes an identity and its private keys
/// - Parameter identity: Identity to delete
/// - Throws: IdentityError if deletion fails or identity is active
func deleteIdentity(_ identity: Identity) throws
```

### **2. Core Implementation**
Added `deleteIdentity` method to `CoreDataIdentityManager`:

```swift
func deleteIdentity(_ identity: Identity) throws {
    // Prevent deletion of active identity
    if let activeIdentity = getActiveIdentity(), activeIdentity.id == identity.id {
        throw IdentityError.cannotDeleteActiveIdentity
    }
    
    // Delete from Core Data
    let request: NSFetchRequest<IdentityEntity> = IdentityEntity.fetchRequest()
    request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "id == %@", identity.id as CVarArg)
    request.fetchLimit = 1
    
    let entities = try context.fetch(request)
    guard let entity = entities.first else {
        throw IdentityError.identityNotFound
    }
    
    context.delete(entity)
    
    // Delete private keys from Keychain
    try KeychainManager.deleteX25519PrivateKey(identifier: identity.id.uuidString)
    
    if identity.ed25519KeyPair != nil {
        try KeychainManager.deleteEd25519PrivateKey(identifier: identity.id.uuidString)
    }
    
    try context.save()
}
```

### **3. Error Handling**
Added new error case to `IdentityError` enum:

```swift
case cannotDeleteActiveIdentity

// Error description:
case .cannotDeleteActiveIdentity:
    return "Cannot delete the active identity. Please activate another identity first."
```

### **4. ViewModel Integration**
Added `deleteIdentity` method to `IdentityManagementViewModel`:

```swift
func deleteIdentity(_ identity: Identity) {
    do {
        try identityManager.deleteIdentity(identity)
        loadIdentities()
        
        // If we deleted the active identity, clear it
        if activeIdentity?.id == identity.id {
            activeIdentity = nil
        }
    } catch {
        errorMessage = "Failed to delete identity: \(error.localizedDescription)"
    }
}
```

### **5. UI Implementation**
Added delete functionality to `IdentityManagementView`:

#### **Delete Button:**
- Only appears for **non-active identities**
- Red colored button with bordered style
- Triggers confirmation dialog

#### **Confirmation Dialog:**
```swift
.alert("Delete Identity", isPresented: .constant(identityToDelete != nil)) {
    Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) {
        identityToDelete = nil
    }
    Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
        if let identity = identityToDelete {
            viewModel.deleteIdentity(identity)
            identityToDelete = nil
        }
    }
} message: {
    Text("This will permanently delete the identity and its private keys. This action cannot be undone.")
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

### **1. Active Identity Protection**
- **Cannot delete active identity** - prevents accidental deletion of currently used identity
- **User must activate another identity first** before deleting the current active one

### **2. Complete Cleanup**
- **Core Data deletion** - removes identity record from database
- **Keychain cleanup** - removes both X25519 and Ed25519 private keys
- **Atomic operation** - either everything is deleted or nothing is deleted

### **3. Confirmation Required**
- **Two-step process** - button click + confirmation dialog
- **Clear warning message** - explains the permanent nature of deletion
- **Destructive action styling** - red button indicates dangerous operation

## üì± **User Experience**

### **Button Visibility:**
- **Active Identity:** No delete button (protected)
- **Archived/Inactive Identity:** Delete button available

### **Button Layout:**
```
[Generate QR Code] [Activate] [Delete]  // For inactive identities
[Generate QR Code] [Rotate Keys]        // For active identity
[Generate QR Code] [Archive]            // For active identity (alternative)
```

### **Confirmation Flow:**
1. User taps **"Delete"** button
2. Confirmation dialog appears with warning
3. User can **"Cancel"** or **"Delete"**
4. If confirmed, identity is permanently removed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warnings**

### **For Users:**
- **Permanent Action:** Deletion cannot be undone
- **Backup Recommended:** Create backup before deletion if needed
- **Active Identity Protection:** Cannot delete currently active identity
- **Key Loss:** Private keys are permanently removed from device

### **For Developers:**
- **Keychain Cleanup:** Ensure both key types are properly deleted
- **Error Handling:** Handle keychain deletion failures gracefully
- **UI State:** Refresh identity list after successful deletion
- **Active Identity Check:** Always verify identity is not active before deletion

## üß™ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Successful Deletion:**
1. Create multiple identities
2. Ensure one is active, others are inactive
3. Try to delete inactive identity
4. Confirm deletion
5. Verify identity is removed from list
6. Verify keys are removed from keychain

### **Active Identity Protection:**
1. Try to delete active identity
2. Should show error: "Cannot delete the active identity"
3. Activate different identity
4. Now should be able to delete the previously active identity

### **Error Handling:**
1. Test keychain deletion failures
2. Test Core Data deletion failures
3. Verify proper error messages are shown
4. Verify partial deletions are handled correctly

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Delete button appears only for non-active identities
- ‚úÖ Active identity cannot be deleted
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ Both Core Data and Keychain are cleaned up
- ‚úÖ Identity list refreshes after deletion
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for failures

### **Security Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Private keys are securely removed from keychain
- ‚úÖ No orphaned data remains after deletion
- ‚úÖ Active identity is protected from deletion
- ‚úÖ Atomic operation (all or nothing)

### **UX Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indication (red delete button)
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog with warning message
- ‚úÖ Proper button spacing and styling
- ‚úÖ Error feedback for failed operations

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**

### **To Delete an Identity:**
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Identity Management**
2. Find the identity you want to delete (must not be active)
3. Tap the red **"Delete"** button
4. Read the warning in the confirmation dialog
5. Tap **"Delete"** to confirm or **"Cancel"** to abort
6. Identity will be permanently removed

### **If Identity is Active:**
1. First activate a different identity
2. Then delete the previously active identity
3. Or create a new identity and activate it first

**Identity deletion feature is now fully implemented and ready for use!** üéâ
