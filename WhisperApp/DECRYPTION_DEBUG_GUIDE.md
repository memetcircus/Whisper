# Decryption Debug Guide

## 🔍 Debug Logging Added

I've added comprehensive logging to the decryption process to identify exactly where it's failing.

## 📋 Steps to Debug

### 1. Build and Run
```bash
cd WhisperApp
xcodebuild -project WhisperApp.xcodeproj -scheme WhisperApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build
```

### 2. Run in Simulator
- Open the app in iOS Simulator
- Go to Decrypt view
- Paste the encrypted message from Akif's phone
- Tap "Decrypt Message"

### 3. Check Console Output
The console will show detailed debug information like:

```
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Starting decryption process
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Envelope length: 513
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Step 1 - Parsing envelope...
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ✅ Envelope parsed successfully
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: RKID: [base64 string]
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Step 4 - Finding recipient identity...
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Available identities: 2
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Identity 0: Tugba - RKID: [base64 string]
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Identity 1: Test - RKID: [base64 string]
```

## 🎯 What to Look For

### Expected Failure Points:

1. **Identity Mismatch** (Most Likely)
   ```
   🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ❌ No matching identity found for RKID: [string]
   ```
   **Solution:** The message was encrypted to a different identity than what's on Tugba's phone

2. **Signature Verification Issues**
   ```
   🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Finding sender fingerprint...
   🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: No matching contact found for signature
   ```
   **Solution:** Akif's contact info might not match the signing key

3. **Key Agreement Failure**
   ```
   🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Step 6 - Performing key agreement...
   🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ❌ Decryption failed with error: [error]
   ```
   **Solution:** Cryptographic mismatch between encryption/decryption

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Identity Match
Look for this in the console:
```
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Available identities: X
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Identity 0: [Name] - RKID: [string]
```

Compare the RKIDs with the message RKID. They should match for successful decryption.

### Step 2: Verify Contact Setup
If identities match but signature fails:
1. Check that Akif is added as a contact on Tugba's phone
2. Verify the contact has the correct signing key
3. Ensure the contact is marked as verified

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Encryption
If all else fails, we need to check:
1. Which identity was used for encryption on Akif's phone
2. Which identity exists on Tugba's phone
3. Whether they match

## 🚀 Next Steps

After running the debug:

1. **Copy the console output** and share it
2. **Note which step fails** (Step 1-11)
3. **Check the RKID values** for identity matching

This will tell us exactly what's wrong and how to fix it!

## 🔐 Real-World Scenario

Remember: This is testing real end-to-end encryption between two devices:
- **Akif's phone:** Encrypts message to Tugba's identity
- **Tugba's phone:** Decrypts message using her private key
- **Success requires:** Matching identities and proper contact setup

The debug output will show us exactly where this chain breaks down.
