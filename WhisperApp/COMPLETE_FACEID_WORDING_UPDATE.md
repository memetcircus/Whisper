# Complete Face ID Wording Update - All Settings âœ…

## Overview
Updated ALL biometric authentication terminology throughout the app to be specific to Face ID and accurately reflect encryption/decryption operations instead of generic "biometric" or "signing" terminology.

## Changes Made

### 1. SettingsView.swift (Main Settings Screen)
**Before:**
- Title: "Biometric Settings"
- Description: "Configure Face ID, Touch ID, and biometric authentication"
- Section Header: "Biometric Authentication"
- Footer: "Use biometric authentication to secure your encryption keys"

**After:**
- Title: "Face ID Settings"
- Description: "Configure Face ID authentication for encryption"
- Section Header: "Face ID Authentication"
- Footer: "Use Face ID authentication to secure your encryption keys"

### 2. BiometricSettingsView.swift (Face ID Settings Screen)
**Before:**
- Toggle: "Require for Signing"
- Description: "Require biometric authentication when signing messages"
- Header: "Secure your signing keys with biometric authentication"
- Status: "Signing key enrolled and protected"
- Button: "Enroll Signing Key"
- Info: "You'll need to authenticate each time you sign a message"

**After:**
- Toggle: "Require for Encryption"
- Description: "Require biometric authentication for encrypting and decrypting messages"
- Header: "Secure your encryption keys with biometric authentication"
- Status: "Encryption key enrolled and protected"
- Button: "Enroll Encryption Key"
- Info: "You'll need to authenticate each time you encrypt or decrypt a message"

### 3. BiometricSettingsViewModel.swift (Logic Layer)
**Before:**
- Success: "Signing key enrolled successfully!"
- Errors: "Failed to enroll signing key"

**After:**
- Success: "Encryption key enrolled successfully!"
- Errors: "Failed to enroll encryption key"

## User Experience Impact

### Main Settings Screen
Users now see:
- Clear "Face ID Settings" instead of generic "Biometric Settings"
- Specific mention of Face ID for encryption (not Touch ID)
- Consistent terminology throughout

### Face ID Settings Screen
Users now understand:
- Face ID is required for "encryption" operations (not just "signing")
- Authentication happens for both encrypt AND decrypt
- Clear explanation of when Face ID prompts will appear

## Technical Accuracy

### Before (Confusing)
- Mentioned "Touch ID" when only Face ID is used
- Said "signing" when it's actually encryption/decryption
- Generic "biometric" terminology was unclear

### After (Accurate)
- Specific to Face ID (the actual biometric method used)
- Correctly describes encryption/decryption operations
- Clear about when authentication is required

## App Behavior Consistency

The wording now perfectly matches the actual app behavior:
- âœ… Face ID prompt appears when user taps "Encrypt Message"
- âœ… Face ID prompt appears when user taps "Decrypt Message"
- âœ… Settings clearly explain this will happen for "encryption" operations
- âœ… No mention of Touch ID (which isn't used)
- âœ… No confusing "signing" terminology

## Status: âœ… Complete

All biometric authentication terminology has been updated to be:
1. **Specific**: Face ID (not generic biometric)
2. **Accurate**: Encryption/decryption (not signing)
3. **Consistent**: Same terminology across all screens
4. **User-friendly**: Clear about when Face ID is required

The app now provides a crystal-clear user experience about Face ID authentication! ðŸŽ‰
