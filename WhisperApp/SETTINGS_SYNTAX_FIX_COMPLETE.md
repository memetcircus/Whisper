# Settings Syntax Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Resolved
Fixed the build error in SettingsView.swift:
```
/Users/akif/Documents/Whisper/Whisper/UI/Settings/SettingsView.swift:126:1 Extraneous '}' at top level
```

## Root Cause
There was an extra closing brace `}` at the top level of the file, which was causing a syntax error.

## Solution Applied
**Before (Line 126):**
```swift
    }
}

}  // ← This extra brace was causing the error
```

**After:**
```swift
    }
}
```

## Fix Details
- **Removed**: Extraneous closing brace at line 126
- **Preserved**: All the UX improvements and custom components
- **Maintained**: Proper Swift syntax structure

## Verification
✅ **Syntax Error Fixed**: No more "Extraneous '}' at top level" error
✅ **Code Structure**: Proper nesting and closing of all components
✅ **UX Features Preserved**: All the visual improvements remain intact

## Settings UX Features Still Intact
- 🎨 Colorful icons for each setting category
- 📝 Descriptive text for better user understanding
- 🔧 Custom row components (SettingsNavigationRow, SettingsToggleRow, SettingsActionRow)
- 📱 Modern iOS design patterns
- 📋 Section headers and footers with explanatory text
- 🎯 Consistent spacing and alignment

## File Structure Now Correct
```swift
struct SettingsView: View {
    // ... main view implementation
}

// MARK: - Settings Row Components
struct SettingsNavigationRow<Destination: View>: View { ... }
struct SettingsToggleRow: View { ... }
struct SettingsActionRow: View { ... }

#Preview {
    SettingsView()
}
```

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The Settings view syntax error has been resolved and all UX improvements are preserved. The file now has proper Swift syntax and should compile without the "Extraneous '}' at top level" error.
