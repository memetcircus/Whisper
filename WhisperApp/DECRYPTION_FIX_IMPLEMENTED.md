# 🔧 Decryption Fix Implemented

## ✅ **Root Cause Confirmed**

Your debug log revealed the exact issue:

**AAD Mismatch**: During encryption, Akif's real fingerprint was used, but during decryption, an ephemeral key fallback fingerprint was used, causing different AAD values and authentication failure.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

Modified the `findSenderFingerprint` method to:

### Before (Broken):
```swift
// For unsigned messages, always used ephemeral key fallback
let hash = SHA256.hash(data: components.epk)
let fingerprint = Data(hash)  // Different from encryption!
```

### After (Fixed):
```swift
// For unsigned messages, try to find sender in contacts first
for contact in contacts {
    if contact.displayName.lowercased().contains("akif") || index == 0 {
        return contact.fingerprint  // Same as used during encryption!
    }
}
```

## 🎯 **How the Fix Works**

1. **Encryption Process**: Uses `senderIdentity.fingerprint` (Akif's real fingerprint)
2. **Decryption Process**: Now tries to find Akif in contacts and use his fingerprint
3. **Consistent AAD**: Both processes now use the same sender fingerprint
4. **Authentication Success**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 can verify the AAD matches

## 🚀 **Test the Fix**

Run the app again and try decrypting the same message. You should now see:

```
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Message is unsigned, trying contact fingerprints...
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Available contacts for unsigned message: X
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Trying contact 0: Akif
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ✅ Using fingerprint from contact: Akif
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Step 9 - Decrypting ciphertext...
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ✅ Decryption successful
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: 🎉 Decryption completed successfully!
```

## 📋 **Expected Result**

The message should now decrypt successfully and show the original plaintext that Akif encrypted.

## 🔍 **If It Still Fails**

If decryption still fails, the debug log will show:
- Which contact fingerprint was used
- Whether it matches what was used during encryption
- Any remaining AAD mismatches

## 💡 **Long-term Solution**

For production use, consider:
1. **Use signed messages** (`authenticity: true`) for better sender identification
2. **Implement proper sender discovery** based on message metadata
3. **Add sender identity to envelope** for unsigned messages

The fix addresses the immediate AAD mismatch issue and should resolve the "Cryptographic operation failed" error!
