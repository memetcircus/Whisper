# ContactListView Build Fix - Complete

## Overview
Successfully fixed the build errors in ContactListView.swift by restoring the original working code structure while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Build Errors Fixed

### 1. Component Name Conflicts
- **Issue**: AddContactView was looking for `ContactAvatarView` and `TrustBadgeView` but enhanced version renamed them
- **Fix**: Restored original component names (`ContactAvatarView`, `TrustBadgeView`, `ContactRowView`, `SearchBar`)
- **Solution**: Used your working code as the foundation instead of enhanced versions

### 2. Missing Component Definitions
- **Issue**: Enhanced version moved components to separate files or renamed them
- **Fix**: All components are now defined in the same file with original names
- **Result**: AddContactView can now find all required components
