# Message Input Prioritization Fix

## Problem
The message input area in ComposeView was too small (120pt height) while the "Include Signature" section was taking up unnecessary space with its own dedicated section, padding, and background.

## Solution
Modernized the layout to prioritize the message input area by:

### 1. Increased Message Input Size
- **Before**: `minHeight: 120pt`
- **After**: `minHeight: 240pt` (doubled the size)

### 2. Compacted Signature Option
- **Before**: Separate section with full padding and background
- **After**: Inline toggle next to the "Message" label
- Added `.scaleEffect(0.8)` to make toggle more compact
- Used `.labelsHidden()` for cleaner appearance

### 3. Modernized Signature Note
- **Before**: Full-width text block in separate section
- **After**: Compact inline note with info icon
- Only shows when signature is required by policy
- Uses `.caption` font and secondary color

### 4. Removed Redundant Section
- Eliminated the separate `optionsSection` entirely
- Integrated signature controls into `messageInputSection`
- Reduced overall vertical space usage

## Benefits
- **Doubled message input area** from 120pt to 240pt
- **Reduced UI clutter** by removing unnecessary sections
- **Modern inline controls** following iOS design patterns
- **Better space utilization** prioritizing the most important element
- **Maintained accessibility** with proper labels and hints

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Compose/ComposeView.swift`

## Testing
All improvements validated with comprehensive test suite:
- ✅ Message input height increased to 240pt
- ✅ Signature toggle moved inline and compacted
- ✅ Separate options section removed
- ✅ Signature note made compact with icon
- ✅ Toggle scale reduced for modern appearance

The message composition interface now properly prioritizes the message input while maintaining all functionality in a more modern, space-efficient layout.
