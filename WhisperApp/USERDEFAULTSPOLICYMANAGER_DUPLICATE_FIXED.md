# UserDefaultsPolicyManager Duplicate Declaration Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified
You correctly identified that `UserDefaultsPolicyManager` was declared in **two different files**:

1. **ComposeViewModel.swift** - Simple mock implementation
2. **PolicyManager.swift** - Complete canonical implementation

This was causing the redeclaration error:
```
Invalid redeclaration of 'UserDefaultsPolicyManager'
```

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Removed Duplicate from ComposeViewModel.swift
- **REMOVED**: The mock `UserDefaultsPolicyManager` class from `ComposeViewModel.swift`
- **REPLACED WITH**: Comment referencing the canonical implementation
- **KEPT**: The complete `UserDefaultsPolicyManager` implementation in `PolicyManager.swift`

### Before (ComposeViewModel.swift):
```swift
/// Mock PolicyManager for UI development
class UserDefaultsPolicyManager: PolicyManager {
    var contactRequiredToSend: Bool { return true }
    var requireSignatureForVerified: Bool { return true }

    func requiresBiometricForSigning() -> Bool { return false }
}
```

### After (ComposeViewModel.swift):
```swift
// UserDefaultsPolicyManager is defined in PolicyManager.swift
```

## Verification

### ✅ Redeclaration Error ELIMINATED
Running `swiftc -typecheck` on both files shows:
- **NO MORE** "Invalid redeclaration of 'UserDefaultsPolicyManager'" errors
- **NO MORE** redeclaration conflicts
- Clean type hierarchy with single source of truth

### ✅ Remaining Errors Are Expected
The remaining compilation errors are all import/dependency related:
- `Cannot find type 'Contact' in scope`
- `Cannot find type 'Identity' in scope`
- `Cannot find type 'WhisperService' in scope`
- etc.

These are **NOT structural issues** but missing import dependencies, which is expected when compiling files in isolation.

## Impact

### Single Source of Truth Established
- **PolicyManager.swift** now contains the **canonical** `UserDefaultsPolicyManager` implementation
- **ComposeViewModel.swift** references this implementation without duplication
- No more conflicting class definitions

### Benefits of the Canonical Implementation
The `UserDefaultsPolicyManager` in `PolicyManager.swift` is superior because it:
- Has complete property implementations with UserDefaults persistence
- Includes all required PolicyManager protocol methods
- Provides proper policy validation logic
- Supports configurable security policies

## Key Achievement

**The UserDefaultsPolicyManager redeclaration error has been completely resolved!** 

The project now has a clean architecture where:
- Each class is defined in exactly one location
- Dependencies are properly referenced
- No duplicate type definitions exist

## Running Total of Fixed Redeclarations

✅ **MockContactManager** - Fixed (removed from ComposeViewModel.swift)
✅ **PublicKeyBundle** - Fixed (removed from ComposeViewModel.swift)  
✅ **IdentityError** - Fixed (removed from ComposeViewModel.swift)
✅ **UserDefaultsPolicyManager** - Fixed (removed from ComposeViewModel.swift)

All major redeclaration conflicts have been systematically eliminated!
