# 🔍 Complete Encryption & Decryption Debug

## ✅ **Debug Logging Added**

I've added comprehensive debug logging to both **encryption** and **decryption** processes.

## 🔐 **Encryption Debug (New)**

When you compose a message on Akif's phone, you'll now see:

```
================================================================================
🔐 WHISPER ENCRYPTION DEBUG LOG - START
================================================================================
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Building canonical context...
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Sender identity: Akif
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Sender fingerprint: ABC123xy=
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Require signature: false
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Flags: 0
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: RKID: H1HGmLAZBpU=
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Recipient fingerprint: DEF456zw=
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: ✅ Canonical context built successfully
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: 🎉 Encryption completed successfully!
================================================================================
```

## 🔍 **Decryption Debug (Enhanced)**

When you decrypt on Tugba's phone, you'll see:

```
================================================================================
🔍 WHISPER DECRYPTION DEBUG LOG - START
================================================================================
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ✅ Using fingerprint from contact: Akif
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Contact fingerprint: Q1EfxmSh5vY=
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Step 9 - Decrypting ciphertext...
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: ❌ DECRYPTION FAILED (if fingerprints don't match)
================================================================================
```

## 🎯 **What to Test**

### Step 1: Create New Message on Akif's Phone
1. **Go to Compose** on Akif's phone
2. **Select Tugba** as recipient
3. **Uncheck signature** (as you mentioned)
4. **Type a test message** (e.g., "debug test")
5. **Tap Encrypt** and **copy the console output**

### Step 2: Decrypt on Tugba's Phone
1. **Paste the encrypted message** on Tugba's phone
2. **Tap Decrypt** and **copy the console output**

## 🔍 **What We're Looking For**

Compare these two values:

**From Encryption Log:**
```
🔐 ENCRYPT DEBUG: Sender fingerprint: ABC123xy=
```

**From Decryption Log:**
```
🔍 DECRYPT DEBUG: Contact fingerprint: Q1EfxmSh5vY=
```

### If They Match: ✅
- The fingerprints are correct
- The issue is elsewhere (different AAD component)

### If They Don't Match: ❌
- **Root cause found!**
- Akif's real fingerprint ≠ Akif's contact fingerprint on Tugba's phone
- **Solution:** Update Akif's contact with correct fingerprint

## 🚀 **Expected Outcome**

This will definitively show us:
1. **Exact sender fingerprint** used during encryption
2. **Exact sender fingerprint** used during decryption  
3. **Whether they match** or not
4. **The exact fix needed**

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the test** with new message
2. **Copy both debug logs** (encryption + decryption)
3. **Compare the fingerprints**
4. **Apply the exact fix** based on the comparison

This will solve the AAD mismatch issue once and for all!
