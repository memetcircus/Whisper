print("🔐 BACKUP & RESTORE PERMISSION FIX")
print("==================================")

print("\n❌ PERMISSION ERROR IDENTIFIED:")
print("   Error: 'The file couldn't be opened because you don't have permission to view it'")
print("   Cause: iOS security restrictions on accessing files from document picker")
print("   Issue: Missing startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() call")

print("\n✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")

print("\n   1. SECURITY-SCOPED RESOURCE ACCESS:")
print("      - Added url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() before reading file")
print("      - Added defer block with url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()")
print("      - Proper iOS file permission handling")

print("\n   2. IMPROVED RESTORE FLOW:")
print("      - Added backupData and showingRestoreSheet to ViewModel")
print("      - File import now stores data and shows restore sheet automatically")
print("      - Removed redundant file picker from restore sheet")
print("      - Streamlined user experience")

print("\n   3. BETTER ERROR HANDLING:")
print("      - Clear error messages for permission issues")
print("      - Debug logging for file access")
print("      - Proper cleanup with defer blocks")

print("\n✅ FILES MODIFIED:")
print("   - WhisperApp/WhisperApp/UI/Settings/BackupRestoreViewModel.swift")
print("   - WhisperApp/WhisperApp/UI/Settings/BackupRestoreView.swift")

print("\n✅ NEW FLOW:")
print("   1. User taps 'Restore from Backup'")
print("   2. Document picker opens")
print("   3. User selects backup file")
print("   4. App requests security-scoped access")
print("   5. File data is read and stored")
print("   6. Restore sheet appears with passphrase field")
print("   7. User enters passphrase and restores")

print("\n🧪 TESTING STEPS:")
print("   1. Copy both modified files to Xcode")
print("   2. Build and run on iPhone")
print("   3. Create a backup and save to Files app")
print("   4. Go to Settings > Backup & Restore")
print("   5. Tap 'Restore from Backup'")
print("   6. Select the backup file from Files app")
print("   7. Restore sheet should appear (no permission error)")
print("   8. Enter passphrase and complete restore")

print("\n✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:")
print("   - No permission errors when selecting backup files")
print("   - Smooth file import and restore process")
print("   - Clear success/error messages")
print("   - Proper iOS security compliance")

print("\n🚀 Permission issues fixed! Backup & restore should work properly now.")
