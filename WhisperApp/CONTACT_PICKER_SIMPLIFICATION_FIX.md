# Contact Picker Simplification Fix

## Problems Addressed

1. **Unnecessary "Show only verified contacts" toggle** - redundant since we should only show verified contacts
2. **Redundant "Verified" tags** - not needed when all displayed contacts are verified
3. **Oversized contact name font** - "Akif (Rotated...)" was too large using `.headline`
4. **Bold formatting** on contact names was too prominent

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Verification Toggle
- **Before**: Had toggle to switch between verified and all contacts
- **After**: Always shows only verified contacts (security best practice)
- Removed `@State private var showOnlyVerified` variable
- Simplified logic to always filter verified contacts

### 2. Removed Verified Tags
- **Before**: Showed "Verified" badge next to each contact
- **After**: No badges needed since all contacts are verified
- Removed `TrustBadgeView(trustLevel: contact.trustLevel)` component
- Cleaner, less cluttered interface

### 3. Fixed Contact Name Font Size
- **Before**: Used `.font(.headline)` - too large and prominent
- **After**: Uses `.font(.body)` - appropriate size for list items
- Better visual hierarchy and readability

### 4. Simplified Contact Row Layout
- **Before**: Complex HStack with name, spacer, and trust badge
- **After**: Simple VStack with name and ID, spacer, chevron
- Cleaner, more streamlined appearance

### 5. Improved Empty State
- **Before**: Complex empty state with toggle options
- **After**: Simple message about needing verified contacts
- Removed "Show All Contacts" button (not needed)

## Code Changes

### Before (Complex)
```swift
@State private var showOnlyVerified = true

// Complex toggle section
HStack {
    Toggle("Show only verified contacts", isOn: $showOnlyVerified)
    // ...
}

// Complex contact row with trust badge
HStack {
    Text(contact.displayName)
        .font(.headline)  // Too large
    Spacer()
    TrustBadgeView(trustLevel: contact.trustLevel)  // Redundant
}
```

### After (Simplified)
```swift
// No toggle needed - always verified

// Simple contact row
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
    Text(contact.displayName)
        .font(.body)  // Appropriate size
    Text("ID: \(contact.shortFingerprint)")
        .font(.caption)
}
```
