# Biometric Settings Wording Update - Complete ✅

## Overview
Updated all biometric settings terminology to accurately reflect that Face ID is now used for both **encryption** and **decryption** operations, not just signing.

## Changes Made

### BiometricSettingsView.swift
1. **Toggle Label**: `"Require for Signing"` → `"Require for Encryption"`
2. **Toggle Description**: `"Require biometric authentication when signing messages"` → `"Require biometric authentication for encrypting and decrypting messages"`
3. **Header Description**: `"Secure your signing keys with biometric authentication"` → `"Secure your encryption keys with biometric authentication"`
4. **Status Text**: `"Signing key enrolled and protected"` → `"Encryption key enrolled and protected"`
5. **Button Text**: `"Enroll Signing Key"` → `"Enroll Encryption Key"`
6. **Alert Title**: `"Enroll Signing Key"` → `"Enroll Encryption Key"`
7. **Alert Messages**: Updated to mention "encrypt or decrypt" instead of just "sign"
8. **Information Section**: Updated to explain authentication is needed for both encryption and decryption

### BiometricSettingsViewModel.swift
1. **Success Message**: `"Signing key enrolled successfully!"` → `"Encryption key enrolled successfully!"`
2. **Error Messages**: Updated "signing key" references to "encryption key"

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- Confusing terminology suggesting Face ID was only for "signing"
- Users might think Face ID wasn't needed for decryption
- Inconsistent with actual app behavior

### After
- Clear terminology explaining Face ID is for "encryption" operations
- Users understand Face ID is required for both encrypt and decrypt
- Consistent with actual app behavior where Face ID prompts appear for both operations

## Technical Details

The underlying functionality remains unchanged - Face ID authentication still works for both:
- **Encrypt Message**: Face ID prompt when user taps "Encrypt Message" 
- **Decrypt Message**: Face ID prompt when user taps "Decrypt Message"

Only the user-facing terminology has been updated for clarity and accuracy.

## Testing
- All wording changes verified in source files
- UI terminology now matches actual app behavior
- Settings screen provides clear explanation of when Face ID is required

## Status: ✅ Complete
The biometric settings now use accurate, user-friendly terminology that clearly explains Face ID is used for both encryption and decryption operations.
