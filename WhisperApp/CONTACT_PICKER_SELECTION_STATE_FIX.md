# Contact Picker Selection State Fix

## Issue Fixed
The contact picker was showing checkmarks for ALL contacts when opened, instead of only showing a checkmark for the currently selected contact. This created confusing UX where every contact appeared to be selected.

## Root Cause
The `ContactPickerRowView` was unconditionally showing a checkmark for every contact:

```swift
// WRONG: Always shows checkmark
Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
    .foregroundColor(.blue)
    .font(.title2)
```

The view wasn't receiving or checking the selection state of individual contacts.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Selection State Parameter
Modified `ContactPickerRowView` to accept an `isSelected` parameter:

```swift
struct ContactPickerRowView: View {
    let contact: Contact
    let isSelected: Bool  // ← New parameter
    let onTap: () -> Void
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Made Checkmark Conditional
Only show checkmark when the contact is actually selected:

```swift
// Selection indicator - only show checkmark if this contact is selected
if isSelected {
    Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
        .font(.title2)
}
```

### 3. Updated Contact List Logic
Pass the correct selection state when creating contact rows:

```swift
ContactPickerRowView(
    contact: contact,
    isSelected: selectedContact?.id == contact.id,  // ← Compare IDs
    onTap: {
        selectedContact = contact
        dismiss()
    }
)
```

## UX Behavior Fixed

### Before:
- ❌ All contacts showed checkmarks when picker opened
- ❌ Confusing visual state - everything appeared selected
- ❌ No way to distinguish selected vs unselected contacts

### After:
- ✅ Only the currently selected contact shows a checkmark
- ✅ Unselected contacts show no selection indicator
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected
- ✅ Consistent with identity picker behavior

## User Experience Impact

1. **Clear Selection State**: Users can immediately see which contact (if any) is currently selected
2. **Intuitive Interaction**: Only one contact can be visually selected at a time
3. **Consistent Design**: Matches the identity picker's selection behavior
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No more "everything is selected" visual state

## Technical Implementation

- **Selection Logic**: Uses contact ID comparison (`selectedContact?.id == contact.id`)
- **Conditional Rendering**: Checkmark only appears when `isSelected` is true
- **State Management**: Properly tracks selection state through binding
- **Performance**: Efficient ID-based comparison for selection state

## Files Modified
- `WhisperApp/UI/Compose/ComposeView.swift`
  - Updated `ContactPickerRowView` struct
  - Modified contact list ForEach loop
  - Added conditional checkmark rendering

## Validation
- ✅ Only selected contact shows checkmark
- ✅ Unselected contacts show no indicator
- ✅ Selection state properly tracked via ID comparison
- ✅ Consistent with identity picker UX
- ✅ No build errors introduced

The fix ensures the contact picker behaves intuitively, showing selection state clearly and consistently with the rest of the app's design patterns.
