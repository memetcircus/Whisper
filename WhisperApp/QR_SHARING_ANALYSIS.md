# QR Code Sharing Analysis

## Current Implementation

The QR code sharing is implemented correctly in `QRCodeDisplayView.swift`:

### Share Items Configuration:
```swift
private var shareItems: [Any] {
    // Primary item: QR code image for easy sharing/saving
    return [qrResult.image, qrResult.content]
}
```

### Share Button in Toolbar:
```swift
ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
    Button(action: { showingShareSheet = true }) {
        Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
    }
}
```

### Share Sheet Presentation:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingShareSheet) {
    ShareSheet(items: shareItems)
}
```

## Expected Sharing Options

When users tap the share button in the QR code view, they should see:

### Image Sharing Options:
- **Save to Photos** - Save QR code image to camera roll
- **Copy** - Copy QR code image to clipboard
- **Messages** - Send QR code image via iMessage
- **Mail** - Attach QR code image to email
- **AirDrop** - Share QR code image via AirDrop
- **Social Apps** - Share to Instagram, Twitter, etc.

### Text Sharing Options:
- **Copy** - Copy encrypted message text
- **Notes** - Save encrypted text to Notes app
- **Text Apps** - Share encrypted text via messaging apps

## Troubleshooting

If QR code sharing options are not appearing, possible causes:

### 1. Image Format Issue
The `qrResult.image` might not be in a format that iOS recognizes for sharing.

**Solution**: Ensure the QR code image is a valid UIImage.

### 2. Share Items Order
The order of items in the share array affects what options appear.

**Current Order**: `[qrResult.image, qrResult.content]`
- Image appears first (prioritized)
- Text content appears second

### 3. iOS Version Compatibility
Some sharing options may vary by iOS version.

**Current Implementation**: Uses `UIActivityViewController` which is compatible across iOS versions.

## Testing Steps

To verify QR code sharing works:

1. **Generate QR Code**: Encrypt a message to create QR code
2. **Open QR View**: Tap to view the generated QR code
3. **Tap Share Button**: Tap the share icon in top-right corner
4. **Verify Options**: Check that image sharing options appear:
   - Save to Photos
   - Copy (image)
   - Messages/Mail with image attachment
   - AirDrop

## Expected User Experience

### Sharing QR Code Image:
1. User taps share button
2. iOS share sheet appears
3. User sees "Save to Photos" option
4. User sees messaging apps with image attachment capability
5. User can AirDrop the QR code image

### Sharing Encrypted Text:
1. User taps share button
2. iOS share sheet appears
3. User sees "Copy" option for text
4. User sees text-based sharing options
5. User can paste encrypted text in other apps

## Implementation Verification

✅ **QR Image Included**: `qrResult.image` is first item in shareItems
✅ **Share Button Present**: Toolbar has share button with correct action
✅ **Share Sheet Configured**: Uses native UIActivityViewController
✅ **Both Formats Available**: Image and text both included for flexibility

The implementation should provide full QR code sharing functionality through iOS's native sharing system.
