# SAS Words Consistency - Final Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Akif's QR code showed different SAS words than Tugba's contact verification screen after scanning.

**Root Cause**: Contact creation was regenerating fingerprint instead of preserving the original from the PublicKeyBundle.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. New Contact Initializer
Added `init(from bundle: PublicKeyBundle)` to preserve original fingerprint and ensure SAS word consistency.

### 2. Updated Contact Creation Flow
Modified `DirectContactAddQRView` to use the new initializer instead of regenerating fingerprint.

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```
Akif's QR Display: SAS words from PublicKeyBundle.fingerprint
Tugba's Verification: SAS words from newly generated Contact.fingerprint
Result: MISMATCH ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Akif's QR Display: SAS words from PublicKeyBundle.fingerprint  
Tugba's Verification: SAS words from preserved PublicKeyBundle.fingerprint
Result: MATCH ✅
```

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **WhisperApp/Core/Contacts/Contact.swift**
   - Added `init(from bundle: PublicKeyBundle)` initializer
   - Preserves original fingerprint, SAS words, and other bundle properties

2. **WhisperApp/UI/Contacts/AddContactView.swift**
   - Updated `DirectContactAddQRView` to use `Contact(from: bundle)`
   - Removed try-catch since new initializer doesn't throw

## 🧪 Validation

- ✅ Test script confirms SAS word consistency
- ✅ All QR scanning flows now preserve original fingerprint
- ✅ Manual contact creation still generates new fingerprint (correct behavior)
- ✅ No security implications - same cryptographic verification

## 🎉 Expected User Experience

1. **Akif generates QR code**: Shows 6 SAS words (e.g., "cool, book, join, fort, glad, love")
2. **Tugba scans QR code**: Contact preview shows same 6 SAS words
3. **Tugba verifies contact**: Verification screen shows same 6 SAS words
4. **Successful verification**: Both users can confirm identical words

## 🔐 Security Maintained

- Fingerprint still derived from public key cryptographically
- SAS words still provide proper verification mechanism  
- No weakening of security model
- Only ensures consistency across UI views

## 📝 Status: COMPLETELY RESOLVED

The SAS words mismatch issue has been fully resolved. Both the QR code owner and scanner will now see identical SAS words, enabling successful contact verification.
