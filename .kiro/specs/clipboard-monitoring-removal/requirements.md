# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Whisper app currently has automatic UIPasteboard monitoring that detects encrypted messages in the clipboard and auto-populates the decrypt input field. This feature causes significant problems during testing and development, as it triggers on unwanted text and results in invalid message format errors. This spec addresses the complete removal of this automatic clipboard awareness feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Automatic Clipboard Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove automatic clipboard monitoring so that the app doesn't interfere with testing and doesn't auto-populate input fields with unwanted clipboard content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically monitor the clipboard for changes
2. WHEN clipboard content changes THEN the system SHALL NOT detect or analyze the clipboard content
3. WHEN the decrypt view is displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT auto-populate input fields from clipboard
4. WHEN testing the app THEN clipboard monitoring SHALL NOT interfere with test scenarios
5. WHEN clipboard contains encrypted messages THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically detect or process them

### Requirement 2: Preserve Manual Paste Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually paste content when needed so that I can still input encrypted messages without automatic interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I manually paste content THEN the system SHALL accept the pasted content normally
2. WHEN I use standard iOS paste gestures THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately
3. WHEN I want to input encrypted messages THEN I can manually paste or type them
4. WHEN using the app THEN manual clipboard operations SHALL work as expected
5. WHEN pasting content THEN the system SHALL NOT perform automatic validation or processing

### Requirement 3: Remove ClipboardMonitor Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all clipboard monitoring code so that there are no remnants of the automatic clipboard feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN ClipboardMonitor class usage SHALL be completely removed or disabled
2. WHEN building the app THEN no clipboard monitoring timers SHALL be active
3. WHEN the app runs THEN no background clipboard polling SHALL occur
4. WHEN examining UI components THEN clipboard monitoring references SHALL be commented out or removed
5. WHEN testing THEN no clipboard-related debug logs SHALL appear

### Requirement 4: Maintain QR Code Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want QR code scanning to continue working normally so that I can still input encrypted messages through QR codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning QR codes THEN the system SHALL continue to work normally
2. WHEN QR codes contain encrypted messages THEN they SHALL be processed correctly
3. WHEN using QR scanning THEN it SHALL NOT be affected by clipboard monitoring removal
4. WHEN QR scanning completes THEN the workflow SHALL proceed as expected
5. WHEN switching between input methods THEN QR functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 5: Improve Testing Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean testing environment so that clipboard monitoring doesn't interfere with test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN clipboard monitoring SHALL NOT cause unexpected behavior
2. WHEN testing input fields THEN they SHALL only change when explicitly modified
3. WHEN debugging THEN clipboard-related log noise SHALL be eliminated
4. WHEN testing different scenarios THEN clipboard content SHALL NOT affect test outcomes
5. WHEN validating functionality THEN tests SHALL have predictable behavior without clipboard interference
