# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Disable ClipboardMonitor in DecryptView
  - Comment out the @StateObject ClipboardMonitor declaration in DecryptView.swift
  - Replace auto-population logic with explanatory comment about removal
  - Ensure DecryptView builds without ClipboardMonitor dependency
  - Verify input field behavior is now manual-only
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Remove clipboard properties from DecryptViewModel
  - Comment out @Published clipboardContent property in DecryptViewModel.swift
  - Remove any clipboard-related computed properties or methods
  - Ensure ViewModel builds without clipboard monitoring dependencies
  - Verify no clipboard-related state management occurs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Validate ClipboardMonitor class is unused
  - Verify ClipboardMonitor.swift file exists but is not instantiated anywhere
  - Confirm no timer-based clipboard polling is active when app runs
  - Check that UIPasteboard.general is not accessed automatically
  - Ensure no background clipboard monitoring occurs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 1.1_

- [ ] 4. Test manual paste functionality preservation
  - Verify standard iOS paste operations work in input fields (long press, Cmd+V)
  - Test that manually pasted content appears correctly in decrypt input field
  - Confirm paste menu appears and functions normally
  - Validate that manual paste doesn't trigger automatic processing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Verify QR code functionality remains intact
  - Test QR code scanning workflow from DecryptView
  - Confirm QR scanner sheet presentation and dismissal work correctly
  - Validate that scanned QR content populates input field properly
  - Ensure QR code processing and decryption continue to work normally
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Validate testing environment improvements
  - Run existing test suite to ensure no clipboard monitoring interference
  - Verify input fields only change when explicitly modified in tests
  - Confirm no clipboard-related debug logs appear during testing
  - Test that clipboard content doesn't affect test outcomes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Create validation tests for clipboard monitoring removal
  - Write test to verify ClipboardMonitor is not instantiated in DecryptView
  - Create test to confirm no automatic clipboard polling occurs
  - Add test to validate input fields don't auto-populate from clipboard
  - Implement test to ensure manual paste functionality works correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 1.4, 2.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Clean up clipboard-related debug logging
  - Remove or comment out clipboard-related print statements
  - Ensure no clipboard monitoring debug messages appear in logs
  - Verify app runs silently without clipboard polling noise
  - Confirm debug logs are clean during normal app operation
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 5.3, 1.2_

- [ ] 9. Document clipboard monitoring removal
  - Create documentation explaining the removal and rationale
  - Document how to manually paste content when needed
  - Provide instructions for re-enabling clipboard monitoring if needed in future
  - Update any relevant user guides or developer documentation
  - _Requirements: All requirements documentation_

- [ ] 10. Final validation and testing
  - Perform comprehensive testing of decrypt workflow without clipboard monitoring
  - Verify app behavior is predictable and doesn't auto-populate unexpectedly
  - Test edge cases where clipboard contains various types of content
  - Confirm overall app stability and performance without clipboard polling
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
