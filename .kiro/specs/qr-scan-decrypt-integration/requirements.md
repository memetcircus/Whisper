# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds QR code scanning capability to the decrypt message flow, allowing users to scan QR codes containing encrypted Whisper messages instead of only being able to manually paste them. Currently, users can generate QR codes for encrypted messages in the compose view, but there's no way to scan these QR codes in the decrypt view, creating an incomplete user workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user receiving an encrypted message via QR code, I want to scan the QR code directly from the decrypt screen, so that I can decrypt the message without having to manually type or paste the encrypted text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on the decrypt screen THEN I SHALL see a QR scan button alongside the manual input option
2. WHEN I tap the QR scan button THEN the system SHALL open the camera scanner interface
3. WHEN I scan a valid encrypted message QR code THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the decrypt input field with the scanned content
4. WHEN I scan an invalid or non-Whisper QR code THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
5. IF camera permission is not granted THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to enable camera access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the QR scanning to integrate seamlessly with the existing decrypt workflow, so that the experience feels natural and consistent with the rest of the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scan a QR code containing an encrypted message THEN the system SHALL validate the message format before populating the input field
2. WHEN the QR scan is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically close the scanner and return to the decrypt view with the message populated
3. WHEN I cancel the QR scan THEN the system SHALL return to the decrypt view without changing the current input
4. WHEN scanning fails due to camera issues THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error handling with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the QR scanning process, so that I understand what's happening and can successfully complete the scan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QR scanner opens THEN I SHALL see clear instructions on how to position the QR code
2. WHEN a QR code is detected THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback to confirm the scan
3. WHEN scanning is in progress THEN I SHALL see appropriate visual indicators
4. WHEN the scan is complete THEN I SHALL receive clear confirmation before returning to the decrypt view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the QR scan button to be easily discoverable and accessible, so that I know this option is available when I need to decrypt a QR code message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the decrypt screen THEN the QR scan button SHALL be prominently displayed and easily identifiable
2. WHEN the decrypt input field is empty THEN both manual input and QR scan options SHALL be equally prominent
3. WHEN I have already entered text manually THEN the QR scan option SHALL still be available to replace the current input
