# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the visual appearance and user experience of the QR Code button in the WhisperApp compose view. Currently, the QR Code button has poor visual hierarchy and styling compared to other action buttons, making it less discoverable and visually unappealing to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user composing an encrypted message, I want the QR Code button to have better visual styling so that it's more discoverable and appealing to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the post-encryption action buttons THEN the QR Code button SHALL have improved visual styling that matches the app's design language
2. WHEN the user sees both Share and QR Code buttons THEN both buttons SHALL have consistent visual weight and hierarchy
3. WHEN the QR Code button is displayed THEN it SHALL include an appropriate icon to improve recognition
4. WHEN the user interacts with the QR Code button THEN it SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the QR Code button to be visually distinct but complementary to the Share button so that I can easily understand both sharing options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both action buttons are displayed THEN the QR Code button SHALL use a complementary color scheme to the Share button
2. WHEN the buttons are arranged horizontally THEN they SHALL have equal visual prominence
3. WHEN the QR Code button is styled THEN it SHALL maintain accessibility standards for contrast and touch targets
4. WHEN the user views the buttons THEN the QR Code button SHALL clearly communicate its function through visual design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the improved QR Code button to maintain proper accessibility support so that I can use it effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QR Code button is restyled THEN it SHALL maintain proper accessibility labels and hints
2. WHEN using VoiceOver or other assistive technologies THEN the button SHALL be properly announced with its function
3. WHEN the button styling changes THEN it SHALL maintain minimum touch target size requirements
4. WHEN color changes are applied THEN they SHALL meet WCAG contrast ratio requirements
