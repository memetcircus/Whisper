3. **Verify iOS deployment target** is 15.0+
4. **Clean build folder** (Product → Clean Build Folder)

### Runtime Problems
1. **Check Xcode console** for error messages
2. **Test on physical device** (not simulator for biometrics)
3. **Verify permissions** (camera for QR codes)
4. **Ensure iOS 15.0+** on test device

### Quick Fix: Create New Project
If the Xcode project has issues:
1. Create new iOS app project in Xcode
2. Copy all Swift files from `WhisperApp/` folders
3. Add Core Data model and configuration files
4. Much faster than debugging project file issues
