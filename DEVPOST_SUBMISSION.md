# Whisper - Military-Grade End-to-End Encryption for iOS

## What it does

Whisper is a revolutionary **serverless, peer-to-peer encryption app** that brings military-grade security to everyday communication. Unlike traditional messaging apps that rely on servers and trust third parties with your data, Whisper operates entirely offline on your device, ensuring your messages remain truly private.

**Core Functionality:**
- **Encrypt messages locally** using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (Curve25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, BLAKE2s)
- **Share encrypted content via QR codes** through any messaging platform (WhatsApp, email, etc.)
- **Decrypt messages** received from verified contacts with biometric authentication
- **Manage multiple cryptographic identities** with automatic key rotation
- **Verify contact authenticity** through Short Authentication String (SAS) verification
- **Zero network connectivity** - your data never leaves your device unencrypted

**Key Innovation:** Whisper transforms any messaging platform into a secure communication channel without requiring the recipient to use the same app or service.

## How we built it

### Technical Architecture
Built entirely in **Swift/SwiftUI** for iOS 15+, Whisper implements a sophisticated layered architecture:

```
User Interface (SwiftUI) ‚Üí Application Services ‚Üí Security & Policy Layer ‚Üí 
Cryptographic Core (CryptoKit) ‚Üí Data Persistence (Core Data + Keychain)
```

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Curve25519 ECDH** for key agreement with perfect forward secrecy
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD** for authenticated encryption
- **BLAKE2s/SHA-256** for cryptographic hashing and key derivation
- **Ed25519** for digital signatures with biometric protection
- **HKDF-SHA256** for secure key derivation with context binding

### Security Features
- **Envelope Protocol**: Custom "whisper1:" format with Base64URL encoding
- **Message Padding**: Traffic analysis resistance with constant-time validation
- **Replay Protection**: 30-day cache with atomic check-and-commit operations
- **Freshness Validation**: ¬±48 hour timestamp window
- **Policy Engine**: Configurable security policies (contact verification, signature requirements, biometric gating)

### Development Process
Implemented through **20 comprehensive tasks** covering:
1. Core encryption system with CryptoKit integration
2. Multiple identity management with secure key storage
3. Contact management with trust verification
4. Security policy enforcement
5. Biometric authentication integration
6. Message padding and replay protection
7. QR code workflow implementation
8. User interface and accessibility
9. Performance optimization
10. Comprehensive security testing

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Cryptographic Complexity**
Implementing military-grade cryptography correctly is notoriously difficult. We faced challenges with:
- **Key derivation context binding** - ensuring each message has unique cryptographic context
- **Constant-time operations** - preventing timing attacks in padding validation
- **Secure memory management** - properly zeroizing ephemeral keys and sensitive data
- **Algorithm lock enforcement** - preventing downgrade attacks while maintaining flexibility

**Solution:** Extensive security testing with timing analysis, memory validation, and comprehensive test vectors.

### 2. **iOS Keychain Integration**
Securely storing cryptographic keys while supporting biometric authentication required deep iOS security knowledge:
- **Access control policies** - balancing security with usability
- **Biometric enrollment changes** - handling Face ID/Touch ID updates
- **Device-only storage** - ensuring keys never leave the device
- **Secure Enclave integration** - leveraging hardware security features

**Solution:** Implemented layered security with fallback mechanisms and comprehensive error handling.

### 3. **Network Isolation Enforcement**
Ensuring zero network connectivity required innovative build-time validation:
- **Symbol detection** - scanning binaries for forbidden networking APIs
- **Build-time enforcement** - failing builds if networking code is detected
- **Comprehensive coverage** - detecting URLSession, Network framework, sockets, etc.

**Solution:** Created Python-based build script that analyzes source code and compiled binaries.

### 4. **Performance vs Security Balance**
Cryptographic operations are computationally expensive, especially on mobile devices:
- **Background processing** - keeping UI responsive during encryption
- **Memory optimization** - managing crypto buffers efficiently
- **Battery impact** - minimizing power consumption
- **Lazy loading** - optimizing identity and contact management

**Solution:** Implemented priority-based background processing with memory pools and intelligent caching.

### 5. **User Experience Complexity**
Making advanced cryptography accessible to everyday users:
- **Key verification workflow** - simplifying SAS word verification
- **Trust management** - clearly communicating security states
- **Error handling** - providing helpful feedback without revealing sensitive information
- **Accessibility** - supporting VoiceOver and Dynamic Type

**Solution:** Extensive UX testing with clear visual indicators and comprehensive accessibility support.
